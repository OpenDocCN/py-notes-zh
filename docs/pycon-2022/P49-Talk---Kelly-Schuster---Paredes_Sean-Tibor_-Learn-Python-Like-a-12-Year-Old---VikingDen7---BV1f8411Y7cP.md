 like a 12-year-old。 And I can see that there might be some 12-year-olds in the audience。 So we're going to help your parents understand how you learn better so that they can help。 you learn faster and easier and all of those great things。 So we're glad you're here too。 \>\> But first， we really need to take a selfie。 So if you get bored and you start looking。

 at your phone， you can go search us up and tag us and like our photos。 Everyone wave。 \>\> Everyone smile。 Nice。 All right。 So， Kelly。 \>\> So I'm Kelly Schuster-Paredes and I'm a teacher who codes。 I work as a computer science， teacher at Pinecrest School in Fort Lauderdale， Florida。 And I am the co-host with Sean here， for Teaching Python。

 \>\> And I'm Sean Tiber and I am now a senior， cloud engineer at Mondowee's International。 We make cookies。 Not the kind that go in your， browser。 but we make Oreos and nutters and all kinds of fun stuff。 And I'm the other。 co-host of Teaching Python。 But before this， Kelly and I work together teaching middle school。

 computer science to over 1，000 students。 \>\> Okay。 So why should you believe us？ Besides。 the fact that I've been with middle school students for about 20 something years， please。 don't judge。 We have taught kids to code in Python。 We used an iterative approach to making。 our curriculum。 We got to do this four times a year for every grade level。 And then we。

 Sean kept saying no， we can do better。 So we've actually taught our courses 50 times plus。 and then more than 1，000 kids in a little bit of three years。 \>\> Yeah。 And this is now the way that kids learn is the way we learn ourselves。 So we've。 been learning from our students to be able to learn better。 And it really does work。 It's。

 really effective。 \>\> And just a side note， I've only been coding for four years。 \>\> So today。 what we'd like for you to take away as an outcome is we want you to get a。 peak at the 12 year old brain， right？ No one can fully understand the brain of a 12 year， old。 right？ But you're going to get a peak at the way that their brain works and the。

 way that they learn things。 That's so that you can learn Python better as an adult。 And。 we want you to have more control over your learning so that it feels like something that。 you can direct and move through in a way that suits you best。 Okay？ Now， your brain is a little。 bit different than a 12 year olds。 We hope， even though you may feel like you're 12 on， the inside。

 right？ \>\> I feel like you're 12 on the inside。 \>\> All the time， all the time。 A 12 year old's brain has a lot of neural plasticity naturally。 It just happens。 They're designed and wired for learning， right？ They really don't have。 a lot of a strong sense of risk and risk taking like the consequences of that behavior， right？

 And they're learning broadly all day long。 As an adult， like the androgygy， this is the。 science of how adults learn， your neuroplasticity is something you have to work for。 So you。 have to be the one making your mind more nimble and making connections， right？ You also have。 a much stronger sense of risk。 And there's a lot of other factors that go into the way。

 that you learn differently， right？ But what we're going to do is talk about some things。 that are really important for 12 year olds that maybe you forgot about a little bit that。 you can bring back to your learning and will help you learn in a much more interesting。 fun and effective way。 \>\> So first and foremost， kids are curious， super curious。

 I love teaching middle school because every single day there's a why but， how but can I？

 But why did you do that？ And what can I do more？ And it's this constant。 curiosity that keeps them in this learning phase。 \>\> And as adults， as you know， we get。 entrenched and when we talk about curiosity， we think in a very narrow way。 Like I'm very。 curious about this one little thing。 We're talking about broad curiosity， right？ We're。

 talking about the ways that we think about the things that are happening around us and。 always asking questions and trying to understand。 \>\> So it's really important to keep in mind。 that as a 12 year old and us any learner， the mind is a muscle。 And just like going to。 the gym every day to work out your muscle， you need to work out your brain muscle and。

 needs to be exercise。 And you need to engage it on these multiple levels。 You can't just。 keep working on one side of your brain or the frontal lobe of your brain。 You need to。 work the entire brain。 Curiosity is a cognitive skill。 It is something that we can learn。 It helps us to stimulate more learning。 It builds purpose in our life and satisfaction。

 in what we're doing。 \>\> So I always tell my parents， your brain is getting older。 You're。 going to start forgetting things。 So you need to maintain this curiosity as you get older。 in order to help prevent this cognitive decline in your brain and the function。 \>\> And something that's really important too is using all of your senses to learn， right？

 We as programmers and coders， we tend to use a lot of visual cues， right？ We were looking。 at our screens while we're coding。 We're feeling the thing， the keyboard as we're typing。 But。 there are other senses that you can engage。 For example， I learned best when I have a hot。 cup of coffee in my hand。 It's the smell of it。 It's the warmth。 It's the taste of it。

 It's like a signal to my brain that says， "Okay， it's learning time。" Sometimes that。 gets me in trouble because you can't drink coffee at 8 o'clock at night and live to tell， the tale。 Then you're up until midnight or later。 \>\> Sometimes you need it as a teacher。 \>\> That's true。 It's important to engage all of your senses。 How am I feeling？ What does。

 this learning experience feel like？ Not just what can I see？ \>\> In Python， as we're learning Python。 the way to hack this is to really question everything。 Ask yourself， "How does this work？

 Why does this work？" Maybe you can't recursively iterate。 all the way down to the base of the binary that's happening on your CPU。 But you can， ask yourself。 "Why is this part working with this other part？ How are these things working， together？

 How do they interact in a new way？" You can also read new code samples。 You can。 look at different code other than the kind you write all the time。 Trey Hunter's talk yesterday。 Python oddities explained。 It was a really great example of this because there's a lot。 of weird things that happen sometimes in Python that you look at and you say， "That doesn't。

 make any sense。" It gets you to be curious about these things。 When something unexpected， happens。 ask， "Why is this happening？ How is this happening？" That curiosity is really， important。 There are books like Fluent Python has really great examples of ways to do things， differently。 more effectively， maybe more Pythonically。 Those are all great ways to stretch your curiosity。

 and learn about things because our students don't just ask， "Did I get it to work？" They're， asking。 "Why did it work this way？" Or， "Is there a different way that I can do this？" And。 that curiosity is really important。 And also， I always ask and I tell the students， "Oh。 why don't you go look at PyPI？ Go look at all the other libraries out there。 You may not。

 understand them， but it's going to open your eyes to what you can do with Python and we。 challenge you to try that too。 Go randomly click through the libraries。"， Yeah。 Something that's kind of fun and we don't think about this because we're always。 sometimes maybe programmed to think about， "Is this the best way？" Ask yourself， "Is。

 there a worse way to do this？" What's the way that isn't as optimal？ Or is there a。 really bad way of implementing it because it stimulates your brain？ Why is it wrong？

 Why does it make things work worse than the way I have it？ So， a good way to do that sometimes。 is to go search on GitHub for a package you're using， right？ Look through the samples of people。 using that code in their projects。 Is that， "Are they using it well？" Or， "Are they not。 using it well？" Ask yourself those questions。 And it's a great way to learn new ways of doing。

 things and stretch your curiosity。 So， 12-year-olds are always learning。 They may not be learning。 what their teachers want them to learn， but they're always learning。 They're trying。 everything in a new way。 They're challenging opportunities in their world。 A middle school。 student has six to eight subjects in a given day， plus sports， plus arts， plus after school。

 reading， plus YouTube， plus Minecraft， plus Fortnite， and I can go on and on。 And they're。 constantly learning how they can improve， how they can play the game better， how they can。 do something easier， how they can probably get their homework done quicker。 And it's。 rare though that they're good at everything all the time， but they still keep learning。

 And what happens when you keep learning， and I'll put my kids in the situation， when they。 are learning， for example， something in Minecraft， or they're trying to try to do something in。 code， it's this feel-good brain hormone that gets released when they do it and it comes。 back with a reward。 This neuroplasticity， this working memory， this muscle workout that。

 they do while they're learning， whether it's with Python or with math or English， it optimizes。 the brain functions。 It helps the movement from the short term to the long term memory and。 helps them to build more connections。 And most importantly， it fosters creativity。 And that's。 something that we want， creativity， innovation， entrepreneurship in our students。 So we want。

 them to learn other things， not just Python， not just math， but anything that they can。 get their hands on to increase that brain activity。 And so how to hack your own Python， learning。 So if you're learning Python as a beginner， if this is the new thing that you're， learning， right。 make space for focus time and diffuse time。 So make those moments where。

 you step away for it and you go for a walk or you try something else， something where。 you're maybe engaging your hands or other motor skills so that your brain has time to。 kind of shift into neutral and process everything that it just learned。 But if you're an expert。 in Python， if you've been coding in Python for a long time， maybe the answer is to learn。

 something new that's not Python， right， learn something totally different that makes you。 uncomfortable that's new。 And you can link back to the things that you already know。 So。 these ideas of connecting concepts and finding things that you can take from something new。 that you're learning to something that you know really well is a proven way to increase。

 the cognitive abilities that you have in your brain increases creativity。 It makes， it more fun。 It increases your confidence。 It's really， really great。 And so you can。 create those connections and build metaphors when you have these outside experiences。 Another。 thing that's really important is to meet people with new perspectives， people who can。

 stimulate your brain in new ways like at a Python conference where you're all here， right？

 Meet someone new， sit at a new table， ask someone， you know， get curious about what。 they're doing and what you can learn from them。 And that newness of it is going to。 stimulate your brain in really interesting ways。 I have to say that I've met somebody that was talking about building bridges in Python。 Anthony Shaw was trying to convince me that I need to teach binary code。 So with all。

 these really cool things that you can do and meet from people。 So this one you've already got a huge step forward。 You're here。 You're at Python。 You。 can meet new people all around you。 And it's something that is a great way to jumpstart。 your learning。 But don't sit in front of the TV， right？ Don't just sit there and like。

 absorb content because it doesn't actually help your brain work better。 This is something。 we're going for a walk or learning how to knit or do something with your hands， do woodworking。 anything that can let your brain kind of idle along and process is what's really going to。 help you kind of process all the new things that you're learning。 Okay， so this one's my favorite。

 12 year olds are emotive， right？ I don't know if you don't， know that word。 It means that they express emotion， right？ They may not always understand， what they're feeling。 but they are definitely feeling it。 You can sit there and look at。 a kid learning to code or learning how to figure out something in Python， whether it's。

 how to iterate over a list。 You can tell when they're frustrated。 You can tell when they're， like。 they're determined they're going to get it， right？ So for these two wonderful girls。 we love these girls。 And then when they get it， you， see the smiles。 They emote that energy of。 I feel good。 I like this， right？ So we can learn， a lot about being emotive。

 Adults are kind of good at hiding their feelings or suppressing。 them or kind of pushing them to the side because we're professionals， right？ We need to get。 this done。 You should be able to say， yeah， I did it， right？ Or this was awesome and like。 fist pump or whatever it is that you do to celebrate that emotion。

 So this is really huge and the cognitive parts of your brain without getting into too much。 of the brain science。 If you haven't heard of Barbara Oakley check her out because she。 explains the brain science of learning。 But learning with emotions instead of against， emotions。 First and foremost， I'll do the negative。 We know for a fact and hopefully。

 hopefully you've seen this too。 When you or your child or the children around you， they're。 stressed or you're stressed。 Learning does not happen。 It physically cannot happen because。 your body， your brain was built to shut off and only focus on what is causing you anxiety。 or stress。 Therefore， you have to acknowledge this stress。 You have to acknowledge what。

 is the thing that makes you want to slam your YAML。 Yeah， yelling at my laptop。 Yeah， you。 have to acknowledge that because at that point of time， you're not learning。 So emotions。 are the key to making that knowledge permanent。 Understanding the roles of each emotion， learning。 what to do with them， how to react with them， it's really helpful。 And there's strong evidence。

 for the neuroscience behind it。 There's these feel-good hormones that happen and get released。 It's oxytocin， dopamine and another nora-fren-fren。 I can't say that one。 I've only read it nor。 rep-a-refren。 I don't know。 That one。 But it's mostly dopamine， which is the one that gets。 released and it's that having fun moment that makes you remember。 And we're not saying， "Oh。

 go eat a piece of chocolate and enjoy your ice cream or your coffee。" And that's。 going to help you learn。 You actually have to feel that emotive side， that happiness。 in order to trigger the dopamine to remember。 And stay away from that stress because that， cortisol。 that stuff that gets you， puts a stop to that process of going from your short。

 term to your long term and making those mild inconlections。 Okay。 So how do you hack this， right？

 So how do you make your learning more effective？ The first thing to do is to chunk your learning into smaller pieces。 That way you shorten that， reward cycle and you get more frequent hits of dopamine when you are successful at completing。 something。 And you've seen this probably a lot with the style of coding。 If you're sitting。 there for hours trying to figure something out and you don't get up and you don't move。

 and you don't have something that is the end of that phase， you get more and more tired。 more and more stressed。 Your shoulders hunch up。 You kind of bend in， inwards， right？ But。 if you can break your learning into small chunks， the pomodoro method works really well here。 Learn for 20 minutes。 Take a five minute break。 That way you force yourself to chunk that learning。

 and you reward your brain for doing something really well。 You also want to create intrinsic。 reward systems， right？ So the difference between an intrinsic reward versus an extrinsic reward。 and extrinsic reward is I did awesome， I'm going to eat a piece of chocolate， right？

 An intrinsic reward is I did something great， I'm going to post that on Twitter and share。 it with everyone because I'm really happy about it。 So the extrinsic reward is something。 that you give yourself and kind of replaces those hormones versus the intrinsic reward。 is something that makes you feel good from the inside and rewards those hormones。 Okay？

 And then the other thing to do， especially as you start to chunk this learning， is to。 check in on your emotional state， not just the learning that you've accomplished， but。 how are you feeling right now？ How do you feel about what you just did？ And I know that this。 sounds touchy-feely maybe， you're kind of soft and fuzzy， but it's actually really important。

 because as Kelly talked about， if you're feeling stressed and you're not acknowledging that。 if you're not recognizing it， it means that you're going to continue to feel stressed and。 continue to block the learning from actually happening。 Whereas if you're feeling good。 about things， you want to extend that feeling as much as you can because it's actually helping。

 that what you're learning become long-term knowledge。 I'm going to let you do this one too because。 This one's my favorite。 Twelve-year-olds take risks in their learning， intellectual risks。 One of the last things you develop cognitively in your brain as you become an adult is your。 sense of risk and reward calculations。 Twelve-year-olds， it's measured， have a pretty poor or。

 in some cases， completely absent sense of risk and reward。 But this is actually an evolutionary。 trait that's really important because removing that risk reward as long as they're protected。 and in a safe place allows them to learn faster more creatively and make connections that。 we as adults may be inhibit。 And so as an adult， about 20% of the cells in your brain are there。

 to inhibit risk-taking behaviors， to keep you alive and safe and all of those things。 But。 in kids that doesn't exist， so there's not that stop gap to say， "Maybe this isn't such。 a good idea。"， You mean teachers and students know not to fly drones indoors？ We do now。 Almost hit me in the face。 Just say。 But he learned not to use that button again really， quick。

 Alright， so learning Python with courage。 This is something that I personally took in for， myself。 Four years ago， my boss told me about， you know， I'm a biology major。 Yes， I did， robotics a lot。 Said to me， "Guess what， I need you to teach Python。" And I looked， at her and I said。 "I've never had a coding class in my entire life。 Don't worry， you， can do it。"。

 And I took this intellectual risk。 I had to learn Python in three months before I taught。 it to six and seventh graders。 It was a horrible first quarter。 I'm not going to lie。 But the。 amount of learning that I did in that time was great。 This intellectual risk that kids。 we put kids into， allows them to build this confidence， and to make this creative， you know。

 make all these creative things。 The best thing that。 I love about teaching middle school students is that they come up with the things that。 I believe because of my constraints can't work。 And they prove to me that they can。 You just。 have to have this creativity to go with the things that you believe in。 And this is not。

 the same as being fearless， it's not the same as launching a whole bunch of drones in a， classroom。 But it is a reward。 There's still that dopamine release。 When you take an intellectual。 risk and you are successful or you take an intellectual risk and you fail， but you learn。 something from that failure。 I'm not saying that the intellectual risk with failure is。

 bad at all because as long as you're taking that risk， that dopamine will still come out。 as long as you keep the stress under cover。 And you gain more learning and memory faster。 So the important thing for your learning as an adult is to create spaces where you can。 take that risk。 So maybe you're not ready to take a risk in front of your colleagues。

 your co-workers， your partner or spouse or whoever that you care about most。 But maybe。 you can create a space where you can take risks where other people don't see it unless。 you want them to or create a space where there's people that you trust that you can work with。 So for example， if you're a web developer， try adding some data science。 Try learning。

 some electronics。 Try learning the piano。 Try learning something that you don't know。 Another big risk。 Try teaching someone else。 Like Kelly， I hadn't coded in Python even。 though I had formal education。 I hadn't coded in Python。 I had to learn that in order to teach， it。 That's a lot of risk。 To your ego when you have to get up in front of a room of kids， and say。

 "Here's what I think we're going to do。" And it probably goes wrong。 But we， learn。 Or。 like we said with earlier with trying to find a worse way of doing things。 try building something or making something that you're pretty sure is going to fail。 Because in the event that it actually works， the reward is huge。 So don't always take the， safe bet。

 Try something new。 Try something big and medium wild and see what happens。 And the risk for us as adults is we don't want to feel like we're silly or stupid or。 that we don't get it。 And the reality is we all feel that way sometimes。 Imposter syndrome。 is a real thing。 But everyone here wants you to succeed。 We want you to be successful。

 And only some people really take displeasure in other people's failures。 I don't know who， they are。 But I like this quote and I'm going to say it because he says， "I always seek out the。 things I cannot do so that I may learn to do them。" And if you take on that challenge。 in learning Python and learning writing PiScript， because I really want that in my school soon。

 so some people out there helping PiScript， go take a risk。 Right。 And if we can do it， you can too。 Four years ago， I had never taught a class in， my life。 And I've taught hundreds of students now。 Kelly had never written a line of code， in her life。 Thousands now。 Yeah。 And she teaches the intro to Python， the beginning steps。 Way better than I do now。 She's amazing。

 right？ Because she was willing to take the risk。 Thank you。 All right。 So this is probably my favorite part about brain science is this whole meta。 and this meta cognition activity。 Sean and I did this after every quarter。 I still call， him on the。 you know， on FaceTime and I need a meta out this activity that's not working。

 And it's this process of reflection。 Again， the more times that you're passing from your。 short term to your long term memory， this myelin wraps around your neuron and it makes that。 memory that learning stick。 The more myelin you have， the more opportunities to find connections。 So this meta part， this reflecting is a process of learning。 So we always like to ask our， students。

 what is it that you learned today or what do you think about your learning today？

 Or what didn't you know before today or where are you going to go after today？ It's this。 opportunity to sort through all the experiences and identify what makes it important to you。 Remember， we're looking for that dopamine。 We're looking for that connection。 And it's kind of like today we apply this to our presentation。 We've meted it out forever。

 So think about it this way。 As you've been sitting here， there have been times when you've。 been checked out， right？ There have been times when you like went and looked at your Twitter。 feed or you're like， your mind drifted off into something else。 What were those times。 when that happened？ Which parts of the presentation were less interesting to you？ What other parts。

 when you were on Twitter， did you go， "Oh， wait， wait， what did they just say？ Like， I。 want to hear more about that。" Right？ So this reflective process is really important。 because if we start to think about the way we learn， right， we can become more effective， learners。 And so you can apply this not just to the presentations you see here at PyCon。

 but say that YouTube video that you're watching， the tutorial， which parts of the webpage。 am I skimming past in the documentation because I can't access it， start to think about how。 you're learning and what things are working really， really well and which things are maybe。 not as effective in making your mind drift and wander。

 And I'm going to add in real quick something that we started doing is the start， stop and。 continue what Sean brought in from the business world is something of， "What am I going to。 start doing？ What am I going to stop doing？ And what can I continue to do in my learning。 with PyCon？" So maybe I'm going to stop doing Turtle PyCon because that's what my kids love。

 and I'm really getting really good at PyCon Turtle and start doing something else， maybe。 like request。 Or I'm going to continue doing simple apps and making music with PyCon Co。 because that's really working for the kids。 So start， stop and continue。 And we're on track to finish a couple of minutes early。 So before， when we stop， but。

 before you get up from your chair， we want you to ask yourself these questions， what。 can I start doing？ What will I stop doing and where will I go next in my learning？ So。 don't just get up right away， take a minute and just think about it for a second， close。 your eyes and think and then write it down or do something with it。 And so now our challenge to you。

 Go out and learn something that scares you a bit， okay？ Like shark wrestling or bubble speaking。 My hands aren't shaking anymore。 That's good。 And then add reflections to your learning process。 Be more aware and more mindful of， the way that you're learning new things and then start to hack that process。 Start looking， at ways that you can make it better， more effective。

 cut out the parts that don't work， try something new in your learning process， make it really great。 And then to the younger people out there， I challenge you to talk to your parents and。 let them know how you're learning。 Ask them questions。 Ask them why things happen。 Because。 even if they don't know why something is working the way they are， you can go search it up and。

 you can learn more through that process。 So then once you've done all that， Email us。 We're on Twitter。 We have our weekly podcast， biweekly every month， depending on how I'm， feeling。 We'll see。 But you can listen to all our back catalog at teaching python。fm。 We've got a whole range of experiences， some really amazing guests that have taught us。

 so much and we've learned so much from。 And we can't wait to hear from you。 So for teaching， Python。 this is Sean。 This is Kelly signing off。 All right。 Thank you everyone。
