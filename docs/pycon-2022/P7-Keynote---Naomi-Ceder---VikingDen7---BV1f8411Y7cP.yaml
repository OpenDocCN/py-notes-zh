    by this little gem of a travel memoir that was written by a man named。 Patrick
    Lee Fuhrmer， who in the 1930s， after being thrown out of his last year of British。
    public school because he wasn't serious enough， decided to walk from the Netherlands，
    up the， Rhine。

    a couple of years。 but the focus of his book is not on the places and， the sites
    he visited。 nor is it on the historic events that were unfolding around him because。
    he was crossing Germany and Austria as the Nazis were coming to power。

    he met along the way。 boatmen， truck drivers， farmers， shopkeepers， even occasionally
    an aristocrat。 and their gifts of food， shelter， and companionship。 which sustained
    him along the way in that long journey。 And for me。

    time of gifts。 Gifts that have sustained me in so many ways on my journey over
    the past 20 years to various。 continents， across two genders， through different
    stages of my life。 So that led me to think about how we value and share the gifts
    of our community and how。
  id: totrans-10

- en: people have compared open source communities like the Python community to a
    gift economy。 Now here at PyCon the other day， I heard somebody say， "In Python，
    people know how open source。 works。"， Maybe。 There are a lot of ways to look at
    communities。 I wonder if that understanding of how open source works is the same
    for everyone。

    for communities to think about and to articulate how they。 think their principles
    should work， how their communities should work。 And I want to present a way of
    thinking about our community that makes sense to me。 And who knows。 maybe it will
    at least be fodder for some discussion。 So to be clear。

- en: what I'm about to say is purely my own opinion。 I stepped away from the PSF
    board two years ago。 Please don't blame any of them for this。 But I would say
    that as a community。 a community that is organized around an open source language，
    and an open source ecosystem。 we do have a gift orientation。 The thumbnail definition
    of this is that people contribute what they can。
  id: totrans-13
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我即将说的完全是我个人的观点。我两年前已经退出PSF董事会。请不要责怪他们。但我会说，作为一个围绕开源语言和开源生态系统组织的社区，我们确实有一种馈赠的倾向。这种倾向的简要定义是人们贡献他们所能做的。
- en: when they can， and， in turn share resources and help contributed by others in
    the community。 The thing is we're so used to the values of a market economy that
    it's sort of hard for。 us to consciously grasp how this works。 This kind of gift
    giving is not barter。 We're not doing a one-for-one exchange at the same time。
    And the goal isn't to come out even。
  id: totrans-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 当他们能够时，反过来又分享社区中其他人贡献的资源。问题是我们习惯于市场经济的价值观，因此很难有意识地理解这如何运作。这种馈赠并不是以物易物。我们并不是在同一时间进行一对一的交换，目标也不是要平衡出一个结果。
- en: or actually some studies say that a lot of cultures use。 barter as a way to
    kind of take people from a different group。 It's not that。 That's not what I'm
    talking about。 Instead， I'm talking about someone contributes something and then
    at a later time they're going。 to share something that someone else has contributed。
    No one can demand a gift。
  id: totrans-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 或者实际上一些研究表明，很多文化使用以物易物的方式来接纳来自不同群体的人。这并不是我所指的。相反，我说的是某个人贡献了一些东西，然后在稍后他们将分享其他人贡献的东西。没有人可以要求馈赠。
- en: yet everyone accepts that they're going to contribute as they can。 For example。
    in hunter-gatherer societies， if somebody finds some food or makes a kill， or
    whatever。 they share it with the entire group knowing that everybody else is going。
    to do the same thing if they get the chance。 So this is the sort of gift giving
    that I think we see a lot of in our Python communities。
  id: totrans-16
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 然而每个人都接受他们将尽可能贡献。例如，在狩猎采集社会中，如果有人找到了食物或者打到了猎物，他们会与整个群体分享，知道如果其他人有机会也会这样做。这就是我认为我们在Python社区中看到的馈赠方式。
- en: Some people are contributing code， others documentation， still others the labor
    to hold。 community events like this one， and all of those gifts are freely given
    and everybody。 enjoys the benefits， right？ I mean， it's kind of like a utopian
    and archosyndicalist commune。 or what the animals had in animal， farm before the
    pigs turned into totalitarian dictators。
  id: totrans-17

  zh: 有些人贡献代码，有些人贡献文档，还有一些人负责举办像这样的社区活动，所有这些馈赠都是自愿的，大家都享受着好处，对吧？我的意思是，这有点像一个乌托邦和工会主义的公社，或者在《动物庄园》中，动物们在猪变成极权统治者之前的状态。
- en: And I think for many of us who love this community。 this is the narrative that
    we turn to particularly， in misty nostalgic moments。 which old-timers like me
    experience every pike on。 But I think in those moments we tend to forget that
    things are never quite that simple， never。

- en: quite that perfect， never quite that idyllic。 As Python and our community。 our
    projects and our gatherings have grown， things are not， so clear。 In fact。 a lot
    of people these days I think are questioning whether this model of open。 source
    powered by gifts is still sustainable。 I suppose part of the problem is that the
    open source world in general and Python in particular。
  id: totrans-19

  zh: 从来没有那么完美，也从来没有那么理想。随着Python及我们的社区、项目和聚会的增长，事情变得不那么明确。事实上，很多人现在我认为正在质疑这种以馈赠为动力的开源模型是否仍然可持续。我想问题的一部分是开源世界总体上，尤其是Python。
- en: have been almost too successful。 Even as we've grown in every aspect。 the number
    of users in their demands has grown exponentially， faster。 How can such a relatively
    tiny group of volunteers keep a community and a language used by millions。 going？
    And I think if we look a little bit， it's easy to find examples where things go
    wrong。

- en: And the issue in particular is burnout of the volunteers that make everything
    work。 Many times I've seen what I call shooting stars。 These are people who burst
    onto the scene and start contributing to the community。 usually， in multiple ways，
    showing seemingly superhuman amounts of energy and enthusiasm。 Only a few months
    after their first events， they're organizing other events， they're teaching。

    do that？ The answer usually is that they can't， at least not for very long。

    all of the balls in the air。 And when I tell them that the answer is to do less。
    they have a hard time accepting that。 Sometimes I think maybe they would like

    that isn't appropriate。

    less likely。 to try again and we end up losing those people。 So the end result
    is that our projects。 our community initiatives， whatever it might be， are at

    up finding projects that are abandoned， you know， with unanswered， issues。

    see this as just the way that open source projects work。 I was reading an article
    a couple weeks ago on the sustainability of open source and a。

- en: developer and maintainer of several Java projects characterized open source
    as this is a quote。 a model that relies on people giving more than they can for
    very little or nothing in return。 hoping that there will be someone to take over
    the mantle when the previous person burns， out。 That description of how open source
    works tells me that if we are in fact a gift-giving culture。
  id: totrans-33

    than they can sustain， others who are barely able to sustain what。 they give but

    that these feelings of not getting anything in return。

    in place。 of things that they had been paying cans or hundreds of thousands of
    dollars for without。 acknowledgment， usually without them giving back anything

    other people who feel that their gifts are being， rejected。
  id: totrans-35
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this last is actually a pretty serious thing。 In gift-giving cultures。 refusing
    someone's gift is an insult。 You're basically telling them you don't want them
    to be part of your community。 So that happens。 It's no wonder that they're not
    going to be around to help take over a project。 So clearly， there are some challenges
    that we face as an open source community。 The question is。

- en: Why are we here at a conference like this where there is so much talk about
    community？ Well， again。 this is for the old-timers。 And 20 years ago， the most
    popular explanation。 at least according to the cathedral and the， bizarre， the
    old-timers know what I'm talking about。 was that open source was driven by， self-interest。
    Enlightened self-interest， perhaps。
  id: totrans-40

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 为什么我们会在这样的会议上讨论社区？好吧，这对老前辈们来说又是个话题。20年前，最流行的解释，至少根据《大教堂与集市》，老前辈们知道我在说什么，是开源是由自我利益驱动的。也许是开明的自我利益。
- en: because it was much easier to get what you wanted， if you were agreeable， but
    still self-interest。 People only worked on what interested or benefited them，
    the famous scratch your own， itch。 And beyond that， the only other motivation
    for doing open source things was the ego。 boost that you would get from reflecting
    that you were the one to solve a problem。
  id: totrans-41
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 因为如果你友好，但仍然出于自我利益，你会更容易得到想要的东西。人们只会关注对他们有趣或有利的事情，也就是著名的“抓住自己的痒”。除此之外，做开源事情的唯一其他动机就是从反映出你解决了问题中获得的自我提升。
- en: And that everyone interested in that project would know that。 In fact。 even
    if you were to do something nice， something completely altruistic without。 an
    explicit ego boost for payback， that was only because you could then reflect upon
    how。 noble you were and get your ego boost that way。 In other words， no matter
    what you did。
  id: totrans-42
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 让每个对那个项目感兴趣的人都知道这一点。事实上，即使你做了好事，完全出于利他主义，没有明显的自我提升作为回报，那只是因为你可以反映出自己有多么高尚，从而获得自我提升。换句话说，无论你做什么。
- en: it was self-interest all the way down。 And along with this。 there was this belief
    that if you had enough genially selfish people。 working to scratch only their
    own itches and boost their own egos， this would somehow。 result in the best of
    all possible worlds for everyone。 Now， as you may notice。
  id: totrans-43

  zh: 一切都是出于自我利益。与此同时，有一种信念认为，如果有足够的真正自私的人，只关注自己的需求和提升自己的自尊，这将以某种方式导致每个人都能得到最好的世界。现在，正如你可能注意到的。
- en: this view doesn't have any room for community， for service， for， altruism。 And
    if that's the view you've got of open source， then there is no problem with any
    of。 the examples I mentioned before。 You've got rapid burnout and departure。 Well。

    exhausted。 Well。 look， if they're doing what they want， they'll continue。 And

    those volunteers who wanted to be， those people who wanted to be volunteers。 got
    turned away？ Well， they must not have wanted it bad enough， or maybe they weren't

    of how。 we worked 20 years ago， it comes off to me as an adolescent mix of iron-rand
    and liberal。 capitalism。 And mercifully， it seems to be falling out of favor。

  zh: 所以当我回顾那些关于我们20年前如何工作的共同理解时，这在我看来是一种青少年式的混合，结合了亚铁环和自由资本主义。而且令人欣慰的是，这种思维似乎正在失宠。我希望如此。我相信如此。我并不真想在这里声称道德上的高地。我想在当时。
- en: a lot of us didn't really question that at first。 Even though in practice。 most
    people didn't actually behave that way。 People weren't actually， as far as I can
    tell。 driven only by ego boosts and self-interest。 You know， even in those days。

  zh: 我们很多人在开始时并没有真正质疑这一点。尽管实际上，大多数人并不真的这样行为。就我所知，人们并不是仅仅出于自我膨胀和自我利益。你知道，即使在那些日子里，我们所做的事情对我们所有人都是有益的。这一点是非常明确的。
- en: But there were too many people doing things for community， generous things，
    altruistic， things。 for self-interest to be even the main thing that was driving
    us。 But if you'd asked。 I think a lot of us would have explained， yeah， that's

- en: to the Python community in particular。 And I think that even now， 20 years ago。
    we're still kind of dealing with the after effects， of that。 And in fact。 I think

- en: I came for the language， but I stayed for the community。 Kind of sums up this
    change in thinking from the old days on what's important in the world。 of open
    source and Python。 So that brings me back to this notion of gift giving as essential
    in our community。 And again， let me go back to the hunter-gatherers， the classic
    example of this。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我是因为语言而来，却是为了社区而留。这个说法总结了从旧时代对开源和Python世界中重要性的思考变化。这让我回到了赠与作为我们社区重要组成部分的观念。再一次，让我回到猎人采集者的经典例子。
- en: If a hunter makes a kill， they share with everyone。 I mean， sure， they want
    to eat。 But so there is self-interest， but they also share it with everybody。
    And it's not even considered to be something special。 It's just what you do in
    that culture。 So we're not hunter-gatherers， I'm not suggesting we go out and
    make a kill and share what-- no， no。

  zh: 如果猎人捕猎成功，他们会与大家分享。我的意思是，当然，他们想吃。但这确实有自私的成分，但他们也与所有人分享。而且这甚至不被视为特别的事情。这就是他们文化中的常态。所以我们并不是狩猎采集者，我并不是建议我们去捕猎然后分享什么——不，不。
- en: no， don't get me wrong。 But I would argue that this pattern appeals to most
    of us。 I think it appeals to humans in general。 And if you look at how people
    behave in our community。 I think it's pretty easy to see， the same ethos at work。
    People who contribute code do so because they can and because it improves things
    for everyone。

  zh: 不，要误解我。但是我会争辩说，这种模式对我们大多数人都有吸引力。我认为这普遍适用于人类。如果你观察我们社区中人们的行为，我认为很容易看出相同的精神在起作用。贡献代码的人这样做是因为他们能够，并且因为这能改善每个人的情况。
- en: Now certainly sometimes the code that they contribute addresses a personal need，
    but many。 many times it doesn't。 And the same thing is true for people who are，
    say。 on a PSF board or for event organizers。 They give a lot of effort。 a lot
    of labor that doesn't benefit them personally。 On the other hand。
