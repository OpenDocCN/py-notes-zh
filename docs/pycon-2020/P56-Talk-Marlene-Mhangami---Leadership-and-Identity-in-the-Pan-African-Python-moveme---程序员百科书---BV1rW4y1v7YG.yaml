    answer some。 of these questions。 So some of you may have heard about Plato。 Plato

    king。 And he's also very well known for his writing， the Republic。 And in the
    Republic。

    most virtuous members of their communities。 And also in earlier writings。 Plato
    is often found to use the metaphor of leaders being， shepherds to their flocks。
    Now Plato isn't the only person to have used this metaphor。
  id: totrans-21
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We actually see it being used in other ancient texts like the Bible where Plato
    may have。 even drawn this imagery from in the first place。 However， in a later
    writing， statesmen。 Plato actually changes his mind about this idea。 And he lets
    us know that actually， no。 we shouldn't use the idea or the picture of， shepherds
    to help us imagine what our leaders should be like because shepherds are humans。
  id: totrans-22

- en: and sheep are sheep。 And so what this metaphor does。 it actually makes us think
    that we are so different from。 our leaders that we're actually entirely different，
    our leaders are actually from an entirely。 different species to us。 So I've placed
    it and entirely reject the idea or this concept of hierarchy。

    So let's go ahead。 let's fast forward to today， we're living in 2020 barely making

    creator of a very cool， functional programming language， called Elm。

    was the hardest part of open source。 And in his talk， he was examining why we
    have so much conflict in our online communities。 And one of the major reasons
    he gave was that a lot of our online communities were actually。 founded on the
    ideology that we can create this virtual space that's free from tyrannies。
  id: totrans-26

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    sometimes don't。 know as much as we do。 But they're creating these rules and structures
    that are oftentimes limiting and in some ways。 can be very harmful and hurtful
    to our communities。 And so many of our online communities。 even today， tend to
    have a very negative view of， hierarchy。
  id: totrans-27
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of leadership。 and people who try to set up structures or hierarchies。 And so
    there's a very negative view on people who are trying to control other people

    So far。

    leadership。 On the one hand， we have this idealized， romanticized view of leaders
    where we see them as these。 perfect people who can do no wrong。 And that's not
    a good view of leadership because we're really then just setting ourselves。 up
    for disappointment because in reality， leaders are just normal people， like you

    where we see。 them as tyrants and people who just want to create structures and
    control other people。 And I also don't think that this is a great view because
    I do think leaders can be really， helpful。 especially when we try and start to
    set up communities。 In different spaces as well。

  zh: 另一方面，我们有一种非常负面的领导者视角，认为他们是暴君，想要创建结构来控制他人。我认为这种看法也不理想，因为领导者在建立社区时可能真的非常有帮助，尤其是在不同的领域。

    leaders？
  id: totrans-31

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 那么，当我们思考领导者时，什么才是正确或好的比喻呢？

    have a correct。 view of leaders， you can actually have a leader standing right
    in front of you and completely。 pass over that person because they don't fit the
    prototype that's in your mind right， now。 So for me， I think I found a pretty
    good metaphor that I personally would use to describe leaders。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我觉得考虑这个问题非常重要，因为如果我们对领导者的看法不正确，你可能会在面前有一位领导，却完全忽视他们，因为他们并不符合你心中的原型。因此，我认为我找到了一个很好的比喻，可以用来描述领导者。
- en: At this point， I would usually ask people to guess what that metaphor is。 But
    you can go ahead actually right now and guess what picture I'm going to use。 But
    for this to answer this question， I'm actually going to go back again to Plato。
    And Plato actually tells us that the picture or the metaphor that we should use
    to describe。

    I'm joking。 I feel like it's a very nuanced answer。 But what I mean by weavers
    is I mean people who create fabric or create a garment out。 of wool。 And Plato
    gives a really great description of why we should see our leaders as weavers。

  zh: 所以，你知道，我觉得这是个显而易见的答案。非常直观。我在开玩笑。我觉得这是一个很有深度的回答。不过，我所说的织布工是指那些用羊毛创造面料或制作衣物的人。柏拉图对为什么我们应该把领导者视为织布工有一个很好的描述。因此，我们将深入探索织造的奇妙世界。

    they。 will take two different types of wool of different consistencies。 And the

    horizontally across the screen is called the "wift。"。

- en: do is they're able to bring together two pieces of wool that are seemingly opposite。
    and bring them together to create one unified garment。 And leaders are able to
    do a similar thing。 What leaders do is they bring together people from different

    This can seem like something that's really easy to do。 But I would actually argue

    in order to be unified， we all have to have the same perspective， the。 same ideas，
    the same experiences。 And I don't think this is true at all。 I think we can come
    from different beliefs， different backgrounds， different experiences。

  zh: 首先，统一并不是同质化。很多人认为，为了实现统一，我们都必须有相同的观点、相同的想法、相同的经历。我认为这根本不对。我认为我们可以来自不同的信仰、不同的背景、不同的经历。
- en: and still be unified in some way。 So just a point here to note is that unity
    doesn't mean we all look the same and we all。 have the same perspectives or the
    same beliefs。 The second thing is that unity is not just diversity。 So you can
    have a really diverse group of people together and maybe actually doing some things。

- en: looking group doesn't mean you have a unified group of people。 So a couple months
    ago。 I found this quote online and I thought it was really moving and。 here it

- en: a unified community， something that we have to talk about is inclusion。 Because

    is tradition。 so we're a pretty fixable family I would say。 But whenever we meet。

  zh: 所以我将和你分享几件事。第一件是传统，我可以说我们是一个相当保守的家庭。但每当我们见面时，都会遵循许多传统。例如，人们问候彼此的方式是有讲究的。

    men。 there has to be a hand thing like this， for the women， it's different and。
    you have to like curtsy and it's like a funny， it's like a whole thing。 But this
    is really key to our identity。 So I'm actually also part of a specific group of
    Zimbabwean people called Shana people。

  zh: 男性和女性的问候方式是不同的。男性要有这样的手势，而女性则不同，你需要行屈膝礼，这是一件有趣的事情。这对于我们的身份认同至关重要。我实际上也是一个特定的**津巴布韦**群体，叫做**沙那族**。

    And so a lot of the things that the traditions that we follow right now have been
    inherited。 from our tribal community or from our tribal history as a Shana person。
    And another thing that I don't know， I think it might just be specific to my family，

    And so whenever we meet something I can guarantee you is that there's going to

    one of the。 first people to get into the house and she just dropped all her things

    fun。 And then a third and final thing about us is food。 So we have some traditional

    just listening and learning from other people， but being vulnerable and being
