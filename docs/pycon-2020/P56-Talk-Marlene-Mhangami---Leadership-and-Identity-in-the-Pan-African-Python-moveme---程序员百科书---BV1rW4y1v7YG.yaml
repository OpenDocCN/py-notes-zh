    I am based in Harai Zimbabwe， which is actually where I am， right now。 And Zimbabwe

    it's sort of a very turbulent country， but I've lived here for almost my entire
    life。

    as imagined， beings。 So Aristotle has a really great quote where he says， "The

    In fact， in 2014。 the New York Times published an article where they were profiling
    a study。

- en: And so for this， I'm going to actually take us back into history to try and
    answer some。 of these questions。 So some of you may have heard about Plato。 Plato
    is a Greek philosopher。 And Plato is very well known for his concept of the philosopher
    king。 And he's also very well known for his writing， the Republic。 And in the
    Republic。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: he actually puts across the notion that leaders should be the smartest。 and
    most virtuous members of their communities。 And also in earlier writings。 Plato
    is often found to use the metaphor of leaders being， shepherds to their flocks。
    Now Plato isn't the only person to have used this metaphor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We actually see it being used in other ancient texts like the Bible where Plato
    may have。 even drawn this imagery from in the first place。 However， in a later
    writing， statesmen。 Plato actually changes his mind about this idea。 And he lets
    us know that actually， no。 we shouldn't use the idea or the picture of， shepherds
    to help us imagine what our leaders should be like because shepherds are humans。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and sheep are sheep。 And so what this metaphor does。 it actually makes us think
    that we are so different from。 our leaders that we're actually entirely different，
    our leaders are actually from an entirely。 different species to us。 So I've placed
    it and entirely reject the idea or this concept of hierarchy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What we see is that he starts us on this journey to start to break down this
    romanticized idea。 of our leaders being these perfect people who do no wrong。
    So let's go ahead。 let's fast forward to today， we're living in 2020 barely making
    it but， living in 2020 nonetheless。 And today we're living in what many people
    would call the information age。 And right now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: information is more accessible than it's ever been before。 And I would argue
    that as a direct result of that， the gap between leaders and their。 followers
    is smaller than it's ever been before as well。 In 2018， Evan Schopke。 who is the
    creator of a very cool， functional programming language， called Elm。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: gave a talk at a conference called Strange Loop。 And the title of this talk
    was the hardest part of open source。 And in his talk， he was examining why we
    have so much conflict in our online communities。 And one of the major reasons
    he gave was that a lot of our online communities were actually。 founded on the
    ideology that we can create this virtual space that's free from tyrannies。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and free from some of these negative dictatorships where people in leadership
    sometimes don't。 know as much as we do。 But they're creating these rules and structures
    that are oftentimes limiting and in some ways。 can be very harmful and hurtful
    to our communities。 And so many of our online communities。 even today， tend to
    have a very negative view of， hierarchy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we also often see a general distrust of people who try to take positions
    of leadership。 and people who try to set up structures or hierarchies。 And so
    there's a very negative view on people who are trying to control other people
    online。 And that's something that I would definitely have to say， I agree with。
    So far。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we've gone ahead and we've looked at two very extreme sort of perspectives on，
    leadership。 On the one hand， we have this idealized， romanticized view of leaders
    where we see them as these。 perfect people who can do no wrong。 And that's not
    a good view of leadership because we're really then just setting ourselves。 up
    for disappointment because in reality， leaders are just normal people， like you
    and， me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then on the other hand， we have this very negative perspective of leaders
    where we see。 them as tyrants and people who just want to create structures and
    control other people。 And I also don't think that this is a great view because
    I do think leaders can be really， helpful。 especially when we try and start to
    set up communities。 In different spaces as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what is actually a correct or good metaphor to use when we're thinking about
    leaders？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I think that this is really important to think about because if we don't
    have a correct。 view of leaders， you can actually have a leader standing right
    in front of you and completely。 pass over that person because they don't fit the
    prototype that's in your mind right， now。 So for me， I think I found a pretty
    good metaphor that I personally would use to describe leaders。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: At this point， I would usually ask people to guess what that metaphor is。 But
    you can go ahead actually right now and guess what picture I'm going to use。 But
    for this to answer this question， I'm actually going to go back again to Plato。
    And Plato actually tells us that the picture or the metaphor that we should use
    to describe。

    I'm joking。 I feel like it's a very nuanced answer。 But what I mean by weavers
    is I mean people who create fabric or create a garment out。 of wool。 And Plato
    gives a really great description of why we should see our leaders as weavers。
    And so for this， we're going to go ahead and dive into the exciting world of weaving。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So for weavers， when they're creating a garment， usually what they will do is
    they。 will take two different types of wool of different consistencies。 And the
    picture you can see on the screen right now， the type of wool that is running。
    horizontally across the screen is called the "wift。"。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that piece of wool is very soft and it's sort of very malleable and kind
    of nice to， the touch。 And the wool that is running vertically is called the "wift。"。
    And that piece is more abrasive and kind of difficult to move。 Plato lets us know
    that good leaders are like weavers because what weavers are able to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: do is they're able to bring together two pieces of wool that are seemingly opposite。
    and bring them together to create one unified garment。 And leaders are able to
    do a similar thing。 What leaders do is they bring together people from different
    perspectives and encourage。 them to collaborate around one unified cause。 So what
    I would say is that good leaders are unifiers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So at first glance， this can seem like something that's pretty straight forward。
    This can seem like something that's really easy to do。 But I would actually argue
    that it's a lot more complex than it seems。 And particularly today。 we're living
    in a world that's really globalized。 And in the Python community。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Python is being used on every single continent in the world。 So from Africa
    to China to Alaska。 Shout out to the Alaska Python user group。 Python is the Python
    community is growing at a really rapid pace。 And this is really exciting for us。
    But at the same time。 I also think that this is something that is very challenging
    because。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the larger our community grows， the more diverse the perspectives become in
    our communities。 And also the harder it is to unify people around a common cause。
    So before I get into what it actually looks like for us to be unifiers and to
    lead in our。 communities， I just want to make a quick comment on things that unity
    is not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the first thing is that unity is not homogeneity。 So many people think that
    in order to be unified， we all have to have the same perspective， the。 same ideas，
    the same experiences。 And I don't think this is true at all。 I think we can come
    from different beliefs， different backgrounds， different experiences。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and still be unified in some way。 So just a point here to note is that unity
    doesn't mean we all look the same and we all。 have the same perspectives or the
    same beliefs。 The second thing is that unity is not just diversity。 So you can
    have a really diverse group of people together and maybe actually doing some things。
    together， but that doesn't mean that they're unified just because you have a really
    diverse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: looking group doesn't mean you have a unified group of people。 So a couple months
    ago。 I found this quote online and I thought it was really moving and。 here it
    is and it says diversity is about demographics。 Inclusion is about a sense of
    belonging。 And I think when we are starting to have these conversations about
    what it looks like to be。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a unified community， something that we have to talk about is inclusion。 Because
    in order for people to feel like they are part of a unified community， they have。
    to have a sense that they belong in that community。 And so inclusion is a really
    big part of this conversation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And how do we make sure that people feel like they belong in our communities？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a philosopher。 a modern day philosopher。 His name is Charles Taylor that is one
    of my favorite philosophers。 And he has a book called Sources of the Self， The
    Making of Modern Identity。 And one of my favorite quotes from his book is the
    one on the screen right now。 And he says。

    to help。 us sort of examine this issue of identity and how it plays out in our

    where I've grown。 up for most of my life。 But my mother， though she lives here
    now。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    country called Shishane。 And my mother， when she was growing up， her family was
    very big。 So she had many， many。 many family members。 And the reason for this
    is because her father， when my grandfather was a chief。 And my mother didn't really
    know her father very well and I didn't know my grandfather。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: really well because he actually died before I was born。 But for my mother。 her
    father was a polygamist。 So he had four wives and my grandmother was actually
    his fourth and final wife。 And I always find that it's really interesting whenever
    I talk to my mother and my grandmother。 about their experiences because it feels
    like they were living in a world that's so different。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from the world that I'm living in right now。 And the picture of me that's on
    the screen right now is actually from a couple of months。 ago in the holidays
    when I went to my mother's hometown and we had a reunion from my mom's。 side where
    all the family members got together。 And during that time。 it had been after a
    period where I had gotten to travel quite a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: bit and interact with people from different communities。 And it was really interesting
    because when I was now there and at this family reunion。 I noticed a number of
    different things that my family does that are really strange and。 that I was just
    like actually in the places that I've been， people aren't doing these things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so I'm going to share a couple of those things with you。 The first thing
    is tradition。 so we're a pretty fixable family I would say。 But whenever we meet。
    there is a lot of tradition that's followed。 So for example。 there's a certain
    way that people have to greet each other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's a way that men greet and there's a way that women greet。 And for the
    men。 there has to be a hand thing like this， for the women， it's different and。
    you have to like curtsy and it's like a funny， it's like a whole thing。 But this
    is really key to our identity。 So I'm actually also part of a specific group of
    Zimbabwean people called Shana people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so a lot of the traditions that we do， that my tribe is the Shana tribe。
    And so a lot of the things that the traditions that we follow right now have been
    inherited。 from our tribal community or from our tribal history as a Shana person。
    And another thing that I don't know， I think it might just be specific to my family，
    but。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also have seen it with a lot of Shana people where they're singing and dancing。
    And so whenever we meet something I can guarantee you is that there's going to
    be singing and。 there's going to be dancing。 So when we were going back for this
    family reunion。 if it had been a long trip， it's quite， far from where I live
    in her。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so when we arrived at the place that we were staying， my grandmother was
    one of the。 first people to get into the house and she just dropped all her things
    and she started。 singing and dancing。 And to be honest， I was very tired and I
    didn't want to sing and I didn't want to dance。 But I have to sing and dance because
    everyone just， it's just what we do and it's just。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I just don't think there's an option， I guess， to say no。 But it was always
    fun。 And then a third and final thing about us is food。 So we have some traditional
    foods that we eat as Shana people， as Zimbabwean people as， well。 And one of the
    foods that we have is called sada。 And it's kind of like a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's like a starch substance。 It's almost like mashed。 But it's， no， I don't
    even know。 It's like maize and you're boilous。 And you know， I have said for a
    while now that I just don't think it tastes really great。 I'm sorry to the Zimbabweans
    watching to the Shana people watching， but it tastes okay。 It tastes fine， but
    I personally don't love it。 But I'm eating sada almost two to three times a week
    because it is part of our tradition。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    it。 And it's just part of who we are as Shana people and other part of our tradition。

    Pekon Africa。 and when the conference actually happened。 I actually really love
    to see the way that my personal identity as a Zimbabwean kind of。 played out in
    and is also very similar to a lot of the traditional sort of identities。 of other
    people across the continent of Africa。 And this played out in many different ways

    But what we see is that the minute you start to mix and unify that red， green
    and blue。 you get a vast range of new colors and beautiful colors that we would
    not have seen otherwise。 if these colors had just stayed in isolation。 And today
    I'd like to propose to you that the more diverse our communities are when we。

    goes。 up significantly when we come together as people from different perspectives
    and different。 backgrounds and experiences。 And I think this is really important
    when we think about creating a future that is bright。 and colorful and meets up

    What do our leaders of the future look like？ How do we identify those people？

- en: And I think there are three key parts or three key traits that leaders of our
    future have。 So the first thing is I think they are curious。 These are people
    who are going out of their way to find out about what other people believe。 to
    find out about other people's traditions and cultures。 And they are curious。 They
    are going even to places that don't make them feel comfortable or places that
    are really， new。

    future leaders are humble。 So not always having to make sure that your opinion
    is the loudest and your opinion is。 the one that's being taken all the time。 I
    think good leaders are sometimes able to be in situations with people that they
    disagree。 with and still be humble enough to collaborate with those people。

    just listening and learning from other people， but being vulnerable and being
    able。 to share your own experiences with people from different backgrounds。 And
    I think that way we're able to build empathy and build stronger and more unified
    communities。
