    as well just to get started。 Welcome to the trainer summit。 It's the first。 It's
    a hatchery。 Super excited。 There's so many people here。 I see some people joining。
    I'm super excited to also see some names that I know in this list， participants
    list。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and people I don't know yet。 But I am so excited that this is going on。 Let's
    see here。 There's some opening remarks to do and some sort of housekeeping remarks
    as well。 I will go ahead and let Jackie take over and do some of the housekeeping
    remarks and then。 I have some more。 And then we will get going。 Jackie， are you
    ready？ Yes， I'm sure。 Awesome。

    make you aware that this session is being recorded so that we could upload parts。
    of it if we choose and we will edit that after。 We also want you to be aware that
    the Python code of conduct is still in play here。 even， though we're virtual。
    The guidelines state that everyone abide by the PSF's code of conduct。

- en: not just today， but all the time。 So we want to create an environment where
    folks feel safe to contribute and speak up。 So we just wanted to let you know
    there is some information about where to report there。 as far as the email。 So
    take note of that。 And you can also find the full code of conduct on the Python
    website if you are all listed。 there。 And I will be quiet in the background as
    monitor for the PSF。 Thank you。 Awesome。 Thanks。

    grabbing the code of conduct link there， there's easy way。 to find it if you go
    to the Python main website under about。 There's a code of conduct link that has
    a summary of the code of conduct and at the。

- en: bottom there's that email address。 So really good introduction about myself
    because this event is not about me。 It's about our awesome speakers and about
    trainers。 I am welcome and hi from Champaign， or Bana。 Illinois， we're not in
    Chicago。 I'm a lecturer at the School of Information Sciences at University of
    Illinois。 or Bana， Champaign。 So I'm teaching faculty in a professional program。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've also done some freelance training and I do a lot of informal training in
    my own。 school as well。 So I teach the semester level。 I do more academia training。
    So my research really is about adult professional learning in sort of the data
    science space。 So if you're research programmers， et cetera。 So I'm really interested
    in the trainers community。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Staying close to industry has always been a professional focus of mine because
    I'm from。 industry and it's really important to me to keep that connection maintained。
    Trainers are everywhere and the more I put together everything for this summit，
    the more。 excited I was because so many people are involved with training even
    if you don't have the word。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: trainer in your title or even if you don't identify as an educator necessarily。
    Programming in computer science is a lifelong learning skill which means it's
    also a lifelong。 teaching skill。 And so I think people do it informally and as
    team leads people do it in so many different。 places and I'm really hoping that
    this summit can sort of tease some of those things out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and help create connections。 I'm not going to go into goals a little bit later。
    So I just love how many people teach Python。 So what is a trainer summit？ This
    is a Python。 a Python hatchery event。 Training needs to be expanded all over the
    place。 We've got boot camps。 We've got freelancers。 We've got websites all over
    the place。 There's certifications now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's informal non-formal organization。 There's informal trainings all over
    the place。 There's non-profits around training。 There are so many different iterations
    of how to teach Python。 So there is the existing Python education summit which
    pro tip happening tomorrow and。 you can still register if you want。 That is happening
    tomorrow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I will also be hosting that a little bit earlier in the day。 It is usually really
    great for like K through 12 college。 So like undergrads。 academia and grad students，
    libraries， et cetera。 So this is where you have the science。 like education science
    experts， researchers in， the field practitioners as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the professional Python training is booming really。 And the topics in the
    education summit are often not super relevant for the more industry。 oriented
    education efforts。 So this is a hatchery event。 So this is all very experimental。
    We're going to see how it goes。 I think we have some awesome talks and I'm super
    excited for them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But we're just going to have to play today。 And depending on how many people
    stick around for the breakout sessions。 we're going to get， a little bit creative
    with stuff。 There is a hashtag of pie trainer summit。 which is very long。 I'm
    sorry。 For this event， if you choose to tweet it， tweet about us。 So what we are
    here for， we are all here together to learn about this community， to learn from。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this community and to connect community members together。 So I work in the more
    formal education space and education research space。 And I'm really excited to
    learn more about the hardcore professional development work。 that's happening
    out there。 But I think that there's also a space for the professional development
    trainers to learn。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from the more formal education space。 I think there's so much you can learn
    about from each other and I'm really hoping that。 this event can kind of kickstart
    making those connections。 So even if you don't necessarily identify as an educator，
    maybe you will identify a little。 bit as an educator after this and we can help
    you do your job better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm sure you're great at your job， but we can all learn from each other。 And
    I think that's important。 I just want to make those connections happen and streamline
    those things。 I also really want to explore areas where the Python community，
    where PSF， where other。 where Python itself can provide more support and guidance
    and where other trainer training。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: might help。 You see like what needs are out there， what expertise is out there。
    how can we learn from， each other and help each other help everyone do their best
    work。 I also really want to discover more about the places where trainers not
    only are just， working。 are they all freelancers？ Do companies have dedicated
    training roles internally？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What are the situations when that happens？ Where are trainers surviving， just
    getting the job done？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then where are trainers thriving and what conditions allow someone who's
    working as。 a trainer to really thrive？ So who are trainers？ There's a broad term
    in this context。 So the definition that I came up with for our particular Python
    trainer summit context。 is anyone who's providing structured training and education
    around Python， but more particularly。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: scoping that， tightening the scope down to being outside the formal or graded
    classroom。 Just because I'm teaching Python on a college campus doesn't mean I'm
    not necessarily teaching。 it as an instructor of record。 There's lots of workshops
    that are happening all over the place。 So this can include corporate trainers。
    This can include team leads and mentors， content creators。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: boot camp instructors， makerspace， instructors， informal instructors， inside
    education。 adjacent areas， and academia。 And likely a ton more than I'm totally
    missing because this is all very new。 So the origin story of this event really
    came down to the open spaces from last year's， Python。 I remember going to the
    trainers open space。 I think Trey， you had proposed it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it was amazing and really， really enlightening to learn about how everyone
    is doing this。 And it's a totally different sort of space and I had worked in
    because I'm very much。 more focused in the academic space。 And when I was listening
    to people talk about the questions and needs。 definitely there's， some intersections
    where the education summit can totally help。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I saw a ton of information needs in the community， but a lot of it really
    unique to。 people within the trainers community that isn't always represented
    nicely in the education， summit。 And so information that's not necessarily super
    relevant for the formal education space。 like making contracts and the business
    side of it， et cetera。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I thought this hatchery program would be perfect to sort of play in this
    space and。 see how we can help each other and learn from each other。 Goals of
    this established and share best practices。 Every community has to have some sense
    of norms。 The Python community is amazing at this。 It is driven very much by our
    mission and a vision of the PSF。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: by the code of conduct， et cetera。 As this community is starting to grow more
    informally。 it's important that people start， coming together to establish sort
    of the common behavioral norms around things。 But also to create connections and
    share expertise。 I feel very siloed in my own work and I know that I'm not a lot
    of me who do things that， I do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But there's enough of me that I know where to go and get expertise。 And I know
    that there might be trainers out there feeling the same way。 And so I am hoping
    that this can foster some connections and mentorship， et cetera。 Also really hoping
    to inspire newcomers and about the different kinds of training professions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that are out there and give them a boost because people might be interested
    in doing the dev， work。 but it may not be super compatible with the hours and
    things to their schedule， to， their needs。 et cetera。 And so training and education
    definitely can be a really interesting space。 It definitely was the space that
    gave me the leg up I needed to sort of get into the space。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The education space was the first one that didn't cut the first technical area
    in the。 Python community that did not question my credentials。 They saw the skill
    and let me have opportunities。 And so I think education and training can be an
    interesting bridge to bring more people。 into our community and help them feel
    like they have a voice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's talk about the awesome talks that we have。 We're going to be starting
    super high level talking about what goes into the business。 side of training。
    And dive deep into a few core topics。 so what should our teaching setups look
    like？ What is it like giving a tutorial at Python and some pro tips in there？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then also dealing with the pandemic right now， a lot of us who are in the
    education and。 training space are having to transition to teaching online。 Teaching
    online is different and funky。 I think it's super fun。 I really enjoy teaching
    online and a lot of experience with it。 but it is different and， you have to be，
    there's not a lot of sort of easy given things that we do in person that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: are a little bit harder to translate online。 Okay。 And then we're going to be
    getting into some breakout groups。 I hope there's things that you all want to
    talk about and listen and hear about and questions。 you have， depending on how
    many people stick around towards the end。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will either do sort of dedicated breakout groups。 Checkout rooms in Zoom
    are tad funky。 And so no one wants to sit here and wait for like 10 minutes while
    I sort of point and。 click and do things。 So depending on how many people are
    in here。 we will adjust what the breakout rooms will， look like for stuff。 It
    could just be speed networking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: et cetera。 We'll figure it out when we get there。 Okay。 We're going to talk
    a little bit about Zoom etiquette and then we are going to jam in on。 these talks。
    So only speakers should have their video on this is for bandwidth needs。 If you're
    not here for my face， you're here for the words on the screen。 Please keep yourself
    muted。

    I will。 go ahead and do it for you。 If you're logged in on a phone， Zoom can get
    funky that way。 Please save your questions for the end and type your questions
    into the chat box。 If you need。 if you are not in the place where you can type
    the question fast enough， you。

    read it out for you。 If you have to bail， throw your question in chat and just
    say。 "I have to bail，" here's， my question。 All of this is being recorded and
    I will go up on YouTube as well。

    for me。 So I'm going to talk about the business of training and just a few words
    of introduction。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I am actually a Python trainer， shocking。 No。 I teach Python basically full
    time。 So every day。 I'm typically in a different city， a different country， different
    company， teaching Python。 The lack of travel over the last few months and for
    the next few months has put a bit。 of a kink in that。 So I've been ramping up
    the amount of teaching I do on WebEx and Zoom。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which I've been doing， for a few years。 Anyway， I also offer a whole bunch of
    courses on Python。 data science and Git， not for companies， but for individuals，
    including weekly Python exercise。 I've got a book coming out。 I mean， it's been
    out for a year online。 It's being printed theoretically the next two weeks or
    so for Manning Python workout， which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: has Python exercises。 And basically， I am a full time trainer。 But I wasn't
    always a full time trainer， so let me give you sort of my evolution in my， career。
    So in 1993 or so， I was a web developer。 I worked for HP。 I worked for Time Warner。
    And in 1995。 I decided I was going to move to Israel where I am now。 And I decided，
    well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if I'm already sort of upending everything in my life， I might as， well try
    consulting as well。 And what happened was I was doing some programming and some
    consulting。 And some of my clients came to me and said， you know， instead of you
    doing the programming， for us。 we preferred if you were to teach us what to do。
    And so that was the beginning of my training career。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I started in about 1996 or so。 And I really didn't know what I was doing other
    than sort of trying to explain things。 And you know， as with everything at the
    beginning， you sort of mess around and make mistakes。 And in 2003， then I moved
    back to the US to work in a PhD。 And those of you who have ever been in grad school
    know that the stipend they give you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is not quite enough to survive。 Certainly not if you have a family as I did。
    So I was doing some consulting on the side。 And that was once again some programming
    and some training。 And I knew that I liked doing both of them。 But when we returned
    to Israel， finally。 last international move， returned to Israel in， 2008。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I bumped into someone or his car bumped into me。 And he suggested that maybe
    I could work with a training company and they would just。 sell my training for
    me。 I was like， ah， that's an interesting idea。 And they started to do this。 And
    basically what happened was they would-- and I was training in Python at that
    point。 I was doing a bunch of different things， but mainly Python。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so they would sell about a week per month and then two weeks per month and
    then the。 whole month and then two months in advance。 And at a certain point，
    about 2015。 I was booked more or less solid about four to five， months in advance。
    At which point I called up the training company and said， you know what， guys，
    I'm going。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to go back to doing this on my own。 I finished the PhD。 I think I can concentrate
    on this myself。 And so I have been on my own now， so I guess for about five years
    or so。 And quite frankly。 I've never been happier。 First of all， I'm earning more
    than I did before。 certainly more than I did with the， training company。 I'm going
    to talk about that a little bit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My pipeline is generally six to 10 months long， meaning if someone calls me
    and they， say。 can we have Python training？ I say， yes， how does November sound
    to you？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And they either grown or laugh or if all of those years are some combination。
    Nowadays with the coronavirus， companies are a little less sure that what they
    want to， do。 So now I'm only booked like four or five months in advance。 And of
    course。 their cancellations as well。 But the big thing for me and moving from
    being a developer to being a trainer was fewer arguments。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: less stress， more satisfaction with my job and before Corona and everything，
    travel。 So last year in 2019， I was on the US and in Europe and in Israel where
    I live and in。 India and in China。 And for me， that's a lot of fun。 So how did
    I do this？ Like。 and how can you do this？ And why should you do this？ Or at least
    consider doing this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So here's the thing。 You have to sort of change your mindset about how you see
    training。 especially if you're， a freelancer consultant。 A typical consultant
    thinks of what they do as a service。 I am going to go and talk to my client and
    they're going to ask me to do things and we're。 going to talk about negotiated
    and I'll maybe give them an estimate of what's involved。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And maybe I'll be close and maybe I won't be close and software probably not。
    Training is not like that。 Training is a product。 When you go to the supermarket
    and you want to buy some apples。 you don't go at least in， the supermarkets I
    go to。 You don't go to the counter then start negotiating over how much the apples
    cost。 Rather。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's a price。 You take it or you leave it。 Training is very much the same
    where a company is looking for training。 They will pay your rate for that。 And
    that's it。 It is a product sometimes known as productized consultant。 The other
    thing is from their perspective， from the company's perspective， training is。
    an investment and they budget it accordingly。 What do I mean by that？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They basically think of what a business wants to do。 A business wants to earn
    more and spend less and training helps them to do that。 So training will help
    them solve new problems， i。e。 earn more。 It'll help them solve old problems faster，
    i。e。 spend less。 It'll even encourage employees to stay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Employee retention is very expensive。 And if they can give people training that
    makes them more up on the latest technologies。 or useful technologies， people
    are more willing to stay。 They'll see it as a nice perk。 In fact。 I was at a company
    a few years ago where the head of HR got up before I started。 to speak at my course
    and she said， "You should know everyone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We know that you are going to leave us within the next few years because that's
    what's。 happened in high tech。 But we're hoping that this course will help you
    to stay here longer because you'll appreciate。 what we're doing and to leave it
    and help you in your career after you leave us。"， Amazing。 So companies really
    want the training to help them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're not doing out of the goodness of their hearts。 They're doing it because
    they want to help themselves。 That's fine。 Training managers。 That's the term
    that I use for anyone who's in charge of a training program or at least。 my point
    of contact。 No company actually calls it a training manager。 That's like my term。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They'll call the chief learning officer。 They'll call it someone working in
    the talent management department or talent development。 is now very common as
    a term。 Human resources。 Every company has a slightly different term and a slightly
    different structure。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But the end of the day， they are investment managers。 They are given a pot of
    money and told。 "Make our company earn more and spend less through， training。
    They're going to measure your success based on these courses。"。 And so the training
    managers are always looking around for， "Where can I find a course that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: will improve my company's efficiency， allow us to earn more and spend less？"。
    And they have their pool of traders with whom they work。 But of course。 part of
    the deal here and what I'm trying to talk about is how you can break。 in or sort
    of different techniques to do that。 The training manager is your client in the
    training business。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's hard to understand that at first because if you're doing training， you
    think about。 the students in your course as your clients。 You want to please them。
    You want to teach them。 You want to be able to have the course。 That is all true。
    None of that is wrong。 But at the end of the day， the training manager is the
    one who is going to decide whether to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: invite you back， who is paying you， who is scheduling things with you and with
    whom you。 should have a good relationship。 So I've had times teaching online classes
    sometimes。 The one company I work with a fair amount where we do WebEx classes
    all the time and。 80% of people just don't show up。 And so I make sure to email
    the training manager and say， "Listen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: most people didn't， show up。 Why？"， Because I want her to know what's going
    on and sort of be in the loop of things。 They have to be satisfied。 They have
    to know that they can rely on me and I can rely on them。 So what does this mean
    at the end of the day？ It means that if you have a successful course。 then it
    will be seen as a worthwhile investment。 They look good， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The training manager wants to look to their bosses。 So if you have a successful
    course。 they look good for bringing you in and they will invite。 you back because
    you're going to make them look good again。 If it was an unsuccessful course。 that
    was seen as a bad investment。 Now they might not invite you back at all。 More
    likely。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: at least with the big companies and some of the companies that I've worked，
    with， they'll say。 "Okay， we understand there was a glitch。 What could we do maybe
    next time around to fix it？"。 I have one company that I work with where if we
    do a course for the first time， they。 say we know that it takes a few times the
    day， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: I think what tool are you using to make it just to see that one？ Yeah， this
    is a great question。 So the easy answer to this is that I don't。 And the only
    reason I say that I don't is that when I plug in a projector。 right now， I've
    got a set up where my laptop is plugged into a single monitor。 If I had two monitors
    plugged in， I would see both monitors。 Or if I had my laptop lit open。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'd see my laptop and a monitor。 That's how I'm usually， I'm standing at a podium。
    I have my laptop open in front of me。 And then that projector is a totally separate
    screen。 So it's an extension of the current workspace。 Because of that。 I'm able
    to drag that terminal window onto that workspace。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it's really just an extension of that workspace。 Now the downside is if
    you change workspace。 you're going to lose that window。 Fortunately， in Ubuntu，
    I'm in Ubuntu is where I am here。 I don't remember what version of Ubuntu they
    changed this。 You can actually make it so that when you change， and I think this
    is in fact the default。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: now when you change the workspace that this window is on， that window follows
    you。 And so the two monitors， I guess monitors is what I do。 The two displays
    are actually kind of separate workspaces in a sense by the nature of how。 they
    work。 So in Ubuntu， this works great。 On Mac， I honestly don't know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    on one。 it completely switch workspaces on the other。 I have only accidentally
    used workspaces。 Okay。 Everything just does strange things。 Yeah。 Chris says should
    not。 And Naomi says。 I don't think it does。 Should be independent。 Excellent。

    window manager I used to use called Xmonad。 which I wouldn't wish on to anyone
    now。 And the only reason I really liked it was the workspaces were independent
    that each monitor。 had a separate workspace。 Now it seems like operating systems
    are moving more and more in that direction。

    checking my email。 Whereas they continue to see on this monitor over here the
    correct thing。
  prefs: []

    Macresten。

    true method that we use for teaching in-person。 workshops and the challenge now
    is to move that online。 So our in-person workshops feature participatory live
    coding which has already been talked about。 a little bit today。 Instructors teach
    slowly explaining as they type learners enter the commands as the instructors。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    instructional team that includes helpers and co-instructors。 who are available
    to provide help as needed。 We use colored sticky notes that can be placed on the

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: need help during a workshop and an instructor can also call for those to be
    put up at various。 different points and responses challenges and things like that
    and helpers attend to those。 The advice is needed， the instructional team shares
    the work and broadens the perspective。 on problem solving so they learn from each
    other in addition to helping people in the， room。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So everybody learns in that context。 We have a collaboratively developed curricula。
    We have many different curricula including some Python curricula and many others
    as well。 If these work jobs improve over time through the contributions from our
    instructor communities。 we are novice focused in our instruction。 And again these
    work jobs have evolved around teaching in a classroom。
  prefs: []

    thing that's important that we have both online and in-person with the Carpentries。
    is a robust code of conduct。 And that's a really important part to any workshop
    in our opinion。 So this is a really difficult model to translate online and honestly
    in the past when we've。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    generally。 then don't do it， we have our teaching model， we know that it works，
    it's going to take。 a lot of work for us to reinvent that model in another setting。
    Well。 now the time has come for us to invest that effort into translating this
    model into。

    we can do in translating this？

    So we'll start by identifying the challenges。 One of the biggest things that we've
    heard from our community as a problem is limited。 screen space。 You might have
    an extra monitor， you might have two extra monitors。 Not all of your learners
    are necessarily going to have more than just a tiny little laptop， screen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    then they， also。 if you're going to be live coding， need a coding window open
    next to that。 And heaven forbid you should ask them to participate in another
    window， they're going。 to be juggling windows with notes and all kinds of other
    things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    it doesn't have some of those ingredients that people rely， on in person naturally
    as humans。 You can't see people's faces。 It's really difficult to read the room
    and to see what's going on out there。 We don't have sticky notes。 I'll talk a
    little bit about what our solutions are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    isn't one clear way of doing that unless you create one。 Those side conversations
    that we rely on to provide help and to have coordination among。 helpers and co-instructors，
    they need dedicated channels now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They can't just have a little chat on the side。 Helpers can't take over a learner's
    computer。 Now。 most of the time that's okay。 We don't actually want helpers to
    be doing everything for a learner。 We want the learners to do their typing， but
    there are times when you need to solve a problem。 And the fact that you can't
    take over someone's computer actually turns out to be a major。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    doing this。 but our understanding is that that， doesn't work so well in a workshop
    setting。 And carpentries tend to be social events。 People come away feeling like
    they're part of a community and they report that as being。 an important part of
    their motivation and their happiness with the workshop。

    earlier this week and how。 many different ways can you raise a hand and zoom。
    Well， you've got this little hand icon。 There's the blue one that is just very
    blemising on some interfaces as far as I can tell。 I've never had a room full
    of people who are all able to find their hands。

    a hand clapping thing。 You can， some people just put up their hand and wave it
    around and wait for you to call。 on them which can be hard especially if you're
    the instructor and you can only see like four。 windows at a time because you're
    screen sharing。 And some people type hand in the chat。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I prefer to use the chat for this。 Whatever you choose。 you've got to teach
    your learners how to use that feature and when。 to use it and those sorts of things。
    So you really do need to set aside time in a workshop to talk about these things
    and train。 your learners and how to do it。 You also need to be intentional about
    your communications channel。
  prefs: []

- en: That zoom chat， you know， Elizabeth said at the beginning， it's great that everybody's。
    saying hi from California and hi from New York and hi from wherever you are and
    that's， one。 But when it comes down to business， you've got to keep that chat
    clean because you're probably。 you might be taking hands there。 You might be taking
    questions there and it's really easy for things to get buried。
  prefs: []

    that needs to， happen。 Right。 So think you need to put effort into figuring out
    how the other communications are going。 to happen。 Are you going to be using breakout
    rooms？ How are they going to be used？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Where are people going to socialize and plan？ And what in particular are the
    instructors and helpers going to use to communicate with。 each other？ And that's
    one that you've got to also think through notifications because probably an。 instructor
    is going to turn their notifications off。 What are you going to do if you need
    to get their attention in the middle of an instructional。

    many different kinds of answers here but being intentional and putting effort。
    into planning them is the key。 Trouble shooting。 Thank you， Bocia， for setting
    me up so nicely here。 I don't have to convince you that there are many different
    ways you're going to have to。

    party prior to a workshop。 It's true that oftentimes people won't go to those。
    I've heard of many different ways of trying to sweet talk or strong-arm people
    into attending。 these things。 We don't like strong-arm people in the carpentry。

    considering a cloud-based option that's ready to hand out specifically。 and only
    to people who really have unresolved problems that makes it a little easier if
    you're。 not expecting everybody in your workshop to use these。

    that might fail。

    up earlier。 Again。 the question of what should I use instead of sticky notes？
    So there's a hand， right？

    or I'm done with this task or I'm。 good or you know， there are many different
    things that you can use sticky notes for。 And you can also， we ask our instructors
    to use other kinds of formative assessment。 It's what we call it when you ask
    questions or pull over answers or those kinds of things。

    our meeting。 when I took the picture， we didn't have little X's and the， check
    marks enabled。 We've now turned those on for our zoom room。 So you can do like
    little X and check mark things on the windows in zoom。 If you can get that to
    work for all your learners， that might be a good substitute for sticky。
  prefs: []

    on more rooms and。 seems to work pretty well。 So you can put it together a poll
    for that or there's dozens of other polling platforms。 out there that you can
    use whichever one you like。 You can have people type type done when they're done
    with a task and the chat feedback。

    It's particularly difficult to figure out who hasn't answered。 So you can see
    who has answered but that's one of those situations where you're not necessarily。
    going to know that you've heard from everyone。 And if you're using a chat that
    has emojis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I haven't been able to type any of the emojis， in to zoom because my zoom won't
    do emojis。 But if you have a chat that will do emojis， you're good for that。 Finally，
    well， not finally。 There's a couple more things here。 But if you like to use a
    collaborative notes document。 the main thing to keep in mind for， that is screen
    real estate。

    about how and when you want them to switch over to using it in the event that。

    a workshop can be really helpful especially for people who might fall behind。
    However。
  prefs: []

    to。 be posting that recording somewhere where other people can access it which
    presumably。 is part of the reason why you're recording。 So at this time we're
    not recommending recording for Carpentries workshops。 Our staff are kind of looking
    at the various implications and thinking about this a little。

    a workshop。 let people know， that you're recording and expect that it's going
    to change the behavior of learners in。 your room people may not be as happy about
    having their cameras on for example and they。 may feel a little bit more reluctant
    to ask questions。

- en: Feedback is really important in all of our Carpentries workshops。 We ask our
    instructors to use those sticky notes in a second way which is to have people。
    right on them at the breaks and give them positive and negative feedback。 This
    is really valuable not only for learning about the things you're doing wrong but
    learning。

    for continuing to teach。 This is a sticky note that I keep by my desk to remind
    me on tough days about why we do。 all these things that we do。 So in this case
    again we don't have the real sticky notes but tools like Google Forms work。 well
    for this。 We have a minute card template that we have set up at the Carpentries
    that you can always。

    and start the moderation of。 the questions。 The first one is from Dan。 How do
    Carpentries instructors sign up for online beta teaching lessons？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    talking about our lessons beyond our core。 collection， is that Dan， are you there
    to clarify your question？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think it's probably like the online pilots。 This online teaching workshop。
    since all of our workshops are online right now， it's going。 to be just like signing
    up for regular workshops except that they're going to be online。 Our instructor
    selection process is going to be a little bit different because we are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: assigning a larger instructional team to those workshops。 But our sign up process
    will not change。 Perfect。 Thank you。 That answered his question。 And the second
    question we have is from Matt。 Do you recommend learners have their cameras on
    during instruction？ You know。 I would say that from an instructor's standpoint，
    that's something that you want， to think about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how important that is to you。 Personally， I do find it really valuable when
    people have their cameras on。 But it's a sensitive thing right now as everyone
    stuck at home and sometimes， you know， those。 virtual Zoom backgrounds don't necessarily
    work for everyone。 So I definitely wouldn't require that people have them on whether
    you want to ask people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to have them on。 I would say is sort of an instructor's discretion thing。 If
    you feel like it's valuable to you， I think it's okay to ask。 But also make it
    clear that it is optional。 And I'll just add on to that。 Just from an accessibility
    perspective as well。 We know that the video does pull on the bandwidth。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so for individuals who are attending workshops from， you know， communities
    with low internet。 access and internet speeds or lack of access to the internet
    in general， having them asking。 them to keep their their camera on may present
    issues there as well。 We have about four minutes。 What other questions can we
    answer？ There is one more in from Bridget。 Oh， thank you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So Bridget asked， I found that sitting and starting at a screen all day， somehow
    way more。 exhausting than sitting in in in person live meetings for adapting and
    all day training。 Do you have recommendations on how to adjust to avoid screen
    burnouts？ That's a great question。 Yeah， that's a， I mean， this is a problem in
    person workshops， to some extent。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also staring at the protector all day isn't always that great。 But I personally，
    you know。 it's how you use the breakout rooms。 I think it is kind of key。 Breakouts
    work really well。 They're a really nice socialization option。 And they， but they're
    also good for like exercises。 especially if you have enough help to kind， of send
    out into into breakout rooms。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's still staring at a screen， but talking to other humans and having a
    little bit of， time。 I love the mindfulness yoga breaks。 If that's you， you do
    you， that sounds awesome。 I do， you know。 have taking breaks， scheduling your
    breaks， letting people know what the。 schedule is and sticking to your schedule。
    That's critical in all workshops and especially critical now。

- en: If anyone has other suggestions， put them in the chat。 There are lots of great
    ways of coping with these。 I love paper based activities。 Sure。 If you can。 if
    you need to tell people that they got to have the paper handy， but if they're，
    at home。 then probably they can find them。 And yes， ask the people with pets to
    show them to the camera。

- en: That's a really good tip。 So I'm going to pop in here and say that probably
    to this room。 a lot of the carpentries is new， to a lot of people。 It's super
    not to me。 I've worked with the carpentries for years。 And I loved helping to
    work on this。 like the pilot stuff as well。 One thing that I love about the carpentries
    is that all of our instructor materials and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: training materials for how to do this stuff is available open access for free
    online。 There are so many amazing questions about live coding and all carpentries
    workshops， as。 you mentioned， are entirely live coding。 And I was wondering if
    you could highlight some of the resources and training materials。 that people
    could use if they want to brush up or get some pro tips on incorporating live，
    coding。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    who want to learn more about live coding that。 are hosted by？ Yeah， so we've got
    our instructor for training curriculum that's openly available and I。 will post
    a link to that in the chat shortly。 We've got some positive。 some sort of good
    and bad example videos built into that that， are kind of fun to watch。
  prefs: []

    also。 And am I missing anything？ We did release， we have a series of blog posts。
    So if you are not subscribed to the carpentries blog， now will be a great time
    to do that because。 we've had community members from all over who are volunteering

    to our blog and even our newsletter so you can。 see what's happening。 And then
    I want to make sure we get Kendra's question in before we run out of time。 Kendra
    asks， is there a plan for some group meetings after a few sites have our first。
    online workshops？ So yes， that's the one I was trying to get in the chat。 I'm
    going to post a link。
