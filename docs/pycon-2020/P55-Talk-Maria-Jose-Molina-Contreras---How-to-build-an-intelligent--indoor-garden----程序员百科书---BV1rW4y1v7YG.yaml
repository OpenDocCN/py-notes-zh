    just called me Mariam。 I did the PhD in plant molecular biology and。 for years
    ago I moved to Berlin with a large full of dreams and planning to start a new
    life。 It was a hard moment but thanks to the support from the Berlin Python community。

- en: I was able to keep up。 This allowed me to find a new professional path as a
    data scientist and。 not only that， I also started to use Python for doing a experiment
    at home。 This talk is an example of that。 I wanted to thanks to the Python community
    for each support。 and for believing in me。 So keep in mind that sharing is caring
    so let's all share our knowledge。

    The project that I will talk about is one that held my friends' plans。 Because
    of my。 background in plant and my knowledge in Python， I decided to start playing
    with a whole new， topic。 microcontrollers。 The world was clear， built the simplest
    and functional plant。

- en: water in the system so people without a software or hardware background could
    be able to reproduce。 it at home。 Of course， I wanted to also motivate new people
    to jump into Python。 While doing biological experiments， I never had the chance
    to program any hardware so you have no。 knowledge at all。 But luckily a friend
    of mine went to the Python 2018 and got a microcontroller。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    these microcontroller。"。 And I remember that I answered to that like， "But I don't
    know how to use it， can I break it？

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What do you， what I need to install？ I need to solder something。"， And he told
    me。 "Just connect it to your laptop。 It has Python inside and take a look to the
    keynote。"。 I was so impressed and whole simple things were。 And the keynote by
    Nina was so cool that。 I started to think new project ideas are right away。 And
    it wasn't that moment to say， "Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's clear。 I know that I need to develop this watering system。"。 And now I
    have the key and hope to do it。 But what is the most important when you are starting
    a project？

    I started to draw the。 project image for fun。 And I ended up with planteries because
    I thought that it was so kind。 you know， funny， but at the same time cute and
    it's kind of the image of this project。 Well。 let's just stop talking about the
    logo。 Let's go and review some important concepts。

- en: happy and the watering is key here。 But it's not the only one。 First thing。
    choose your plants based on your environmental condition is key to have success。
    Not really。 All the plants are from outdoors。 But if the idea is created in door
    garden。 you need to have a mine hours of light。 Consider at synthetic light， take
    care of the temperature。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the relative humidity and the orientation of your house。 But it's not the only
    factor that we need to have a mine。 We also consider the moisture sensor。 We need
    to know who is our plant soil and how to measure the moisture of the soil。 There
    are many types of sensors， but I just try two of them。 A resistive and a capacitive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I try a resistive even knowing that they have corrosion problems because it
    was for shorter。 water exposition。 But if you need to leave it all the time， use
    a capacitive。 For that reason。 you're going to see that in some moments I use
    the first one and in other moments。 I use the second option。 To get a creative
    reading out of your soil moisture sensor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it is recommended that you first calibrate it for the particular type of soil
    that you plan to monitor。 Because different types of soil can affect the sensor。
    So your sensor may be more or less sensitive。 depending on the type of soil that
    you use。 And of course， the first thing to do before I start。 the project is take。
    For example， in this case I took three glasses with water， with soil。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: pretty wet and also dry soil。 And I went measuring the balliose from one to
    another。 always from dry， to wet。 And then you need to do experiments and take
    numbers to define what is dry and what is wet。 in numbers parameters。 It's only
    thing now。 Who showed you what are your plan？ Well。 if I ask you which is the
    correct method， A， B or C， the answer is the， penalty。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the species and the state of development。 Not all the plants like the same water
    method。 And maybe you are wondering but why？ Well， an important factor is the
    root distribution。 Applying with superficial growth prefer a method A。 Applying
    with deep growth， A， B， C are fine。 The method A can produce an additional soil
    loss in minerals。 The method B sometimes is not enough。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for the plant receive， if the plant receives a lot of dietitin。 Alternatively。
    the two methods could be a great idea that it's the case C to have a good， mineral
    watering balance。 But let's start considering the method A and or B for our watering
    system。 After this consideration。 we can go to the sign or prototype that is good
    at it。 After half all this。
  prefs: []

- en: Here you can see the initial idea that I have in mind。 I thought， okay， I have
    my plan with a。 moisture sensor connected to the microcontroller and also a water
    pump that somehow can activate。 and activate the water。 It looked really simple
    so I started to read about how to do this。 And I started to buy some components
    but in some cases were a lot of components。

    shape with。 device that you see in C。 The water pump is a white sink in the middle。
    That needed the sternal batteries in this case is five balls so that you can see
    in layer E。 The blue thing on the top is a relay in simple words that it's a signal
    on off。 Sweet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I was able to connect that to control when I was watering。 And of course
    some cables took on the different parts。 The microcontroller that I use it is
    called circuit playground express and it's developed by other。 fruit。 This microcontroller
    has a huge potential for different kind of project because has， motion。

    inside is called。 circuit python which is a form from micro python and it's really
    simple to use。 Totally beginner friendly。 There are many libraries and drivers
    for sensors and you can connect it。 with a USB cable and then you are able to
    start a Python console to interact with it。
  prefs: []

    cables I know and it's not safe to， have the palm next to the relay。 I know also
    that but never mind。 It was just to show you。 in a picture but please don't do
    it at home。 Let's be safe。 Try。 Try。 Don't do it。

    code？

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well I skipped the imports here but I just wanted to show you how to interact，
    with the devices。 Since I was sending signals to the relay I had a digital output
    connection。 and the moisture sensor is an analog input since I needed to read
    a number from it。 The main lobe was really simple。 You get the sensor value and
    if that's less than the。

    After I finished this project or this approach I gave a couple of tools and many
    people was。 interested and started to give me feedback and asked me for new functionalities。
    So I decided to build a bigger system with many more features。

    liquid plate ground。 I also bought a speaker and I put it inside the box。 I don't
    saw up， you can see the red。 water level sensor which is layer B。 And of course
    we have also the old components like the relay。

    fill the water container。 Here it's the code， with a layer a bit longer but still
    simple enough to。

- en: for everyone that wants to try。 I wrote a Python class to keep all the functionalities
    of the system。 so the first thing I do is to create an object called plantaris。
    The main loop had some steps so。 on the right you can see the implementation of
    the functions。 First you can see that the method。 water level okay does something
    similar that we did in the system one just check the value。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and return true or false。 When the level is not okay we play a message there。
    I am just opening a。 WAF file and play it through the speaker。 So that's all you
    need to have a voice notification if the。 water level is slow。 The second condition
    we have is to check if the moisture value is okay。 This is the same code from
    the system one。 I check if the moisture level is okay and if not I would。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: turn out my plan。 Here watering our plant is just opening the relay for a few
    seconds and then close。 it。 If you are thinking there is a mistake because for
    opening I wrote false that it's because the。 relay has two states always close
    or always open since I don't want to have the water pump。 the water pumping all
    time。 I use it the always close gate so that needs to be true to remain。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: always closed。 That is why writing false means that the relay will be open。
    Here of course here is not the the full code you can find the code in the GitHub
    account。 As I was generating a lot of data I decided to do something about it
    and I thought。 I should connect my system to internet。 So I started to look for
    components that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: could help me with that and I noticed a new system by Adafruit called Pyportal
    so I went to the store。 and got it to start playing with。 It's a really interesting
    component with that allows you to have。 I/Ot and also has a screen。 It's super
    cool but even though I did my best I had many issues with。 connecting components
    to the device probably because of my little experience but I spent a lot。

    or gadget and please if。 you have a experience with Pyportal let's be in touch
    because I want to include it in my system。

    too with I/Ot including。 I/Ot I found another path。 I was very lucky because when
    I was looking for options， with I/Ot。 Py Ladies from Berlin and Hamburg decided
    to organize a workshop after the PyCon。 D on the same topic and guess what I got？

    then I thought。 that I could install many other things so what I got if I leave
    a web server running on the Pi。 So I didn't have to worry more about the limited
    storage space on the system since I had the。 SD card of my Pi so I start to check
    how they connect their Raspberry Pi and the microcontrollers。
