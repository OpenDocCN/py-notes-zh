    down， that rabbit hole。 The third non-technical skill that I。

    code and， people。 We're probably very familiar with both， actually， but when you
    kind of， talk about engineering team。 we can， talk about it a little more differently。
    We know about understanding。 assumptions about a problem， but I kind of go a level
    deeper， when I talk about understanding。

    every company to want to hire you， it feels good if every company， wants to hire
    you。 maybe for a small sliver of people， every company does want to hire them。
    but most of us don't fall into that category， you only need one company， to want
    to hire you。

    you don't need to beat yourself up， if a company decides not to move forward。
    with you it just means that they， for whatever reason were not， the right company
    at that time。
