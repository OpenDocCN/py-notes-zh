    rented out or sold their homes and traveled the world while continuing to make
    a full-time salary。 There are actually programs now that facilitate this。 So you

    from anywhere in the world。 If you're trying to get people to come to your office
    in one spot or a few spots around the world。 you've got a limited talent pool，
    right？ You've got to find people who already live there or who are willing to
    live there。 But when you open up to a global talent pool， you've got so many more
    options。 Also。

    you can have smaller or no office space。 You don't have to pay to relocate employees。
    And finally， you can increase employee productivity。 And this might seem a little

    this year， not once， not twice， but three times。 And I didn't have to miss any

    want to work in the office。 But about 40% want to work from home or another place
    such as a co-working space or cafe。 So it's a pretty big chunk of developers who
    want to have a remote work option。 Next。
  id: totrans-72
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they ask developers， how often do you want to work remotely？ So up at the top。
    we see people who pretty much never get to work remotely。 In the middle is sometimes
    down towards the bottom is full time remote。 So you can see up at the top， we've
    got 43% of developers never get to work remotely。
  id: totrans-73
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And down towards the bottom， we've got 12% who get to work remotely full time。
    One interesting stat that they pulled out of this is they found that developers
    who work remotely full time。 have on average about 60% more years of professional
    coding experience than those who never do。 So we can kind of guess why that is，
    you know， if you've got more coding experience。

    their productivity again three months later。 They found a 22% performance increase

    happening。 First。 they schedule times to meet and they'll bring everybody in。
    And then if they forget。 if it truly is a one-off conversation， they'll let the
    team know。 So distributed teams。 fully distributed teams are so much easier to
    work with。 Also， consider the communication styles。

    faces。 But when you're a remote employee， you have to be very vocal。 You have
    to be comfortable saying how you're feeling。 Saying when you're struggling。 saying
    when you disagree， because people aren't going to be able to read it on your face。

- en: So consider the communication styles of the team and you feel comfortable working
    with those personalities。 And finally， this can feel a little awkward， but when
    you find the right team。 I highly recommend that you schedule one-on-ones with
    each team member。 I had a mentor suggest this to me years ago， and it felt so
    awkward at first， but it totally works。

    This is my role。 Here's why I'm excited to be on the team。 Here's a little bit

    the barrier。 Things are more personal。 It's so much easier to go ask them for
    help and for them to communicate with you。 right？ Because you're becoming a real
