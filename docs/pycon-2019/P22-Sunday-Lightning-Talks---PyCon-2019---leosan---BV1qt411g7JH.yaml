- en: I'm just waiting for my slides to show up。 Yeah， there we are。 So my name is
    Jonathan Biddle。 I lead a team called Developer Acceleration at Wayfair。 And today
    I'm going to talk to you about one of the ways。 that we spread best practices
    around Python and Python， excellence across the company。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So for those of you who aren't familiar with Wayfair。 I'll give you just a really
    brief idea of what we do。 We are a e-commerce website that focuses on furniture，
    and home decor。 And we're kind of big a little bit。 We've got 14 million products，
    16。4 million customers， which。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: means we're like 2。4 million products away for literally， having something for
    everyone。 And we've also got 2，300 people across our various tech teams。 So what
    about Python at Wayfair？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well， two years ago， I was given the opportunity to do what I。 think is probably
    my favorite job ever。 And it was basically to figure out how do we。 make it intuitive
    and easy for any software team， to use Python to solve their problems。 and reach
    their business objectives in the form of a Python， platform team at Wayfair。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the things that we thought about early on， is like， OK。 if we're going
    to get a bunch of people adopting， Python。 how do we make sure they adopt Python
    the right way？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How do we make sure they're using idiomatic Python。 and leading into some of
    the Pythonic things that may come。 naturally to you if you'd be doing it for a
    few years。 But out of the gate， our little mystical。 You don't really understand
    what Pythonic means。 If we're going to have a bunch of people doing this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for the first time， it's kind of important， that we have a good story here。
    So we could do a lot of training and point people， to good books to read and things
    like that。 But we were concerned that that wouldn't really， take in the way we
    really wanted。 So what we came up with is this model called Auxiliary， Engineering。
    And what it is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's kind of like embedded engineering。 We go and we work with the team on something。
    But we have two goals。 One， we want that team to be successful。 We want them to
    reach whatever MVP or goal， that they have to achieve some business outcome。 But
    we also want to transform the team in some way。 We want to bring in those best
    practices that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: come second nature to us。 You can recognize any project that we contribute to
    because we。 have a little badge and README files for any of these projects， where
    we've been involved。 So let's talk about what an Occ Times project looks like。
    There's some preparation before we even get started。 One thing that's really important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't want to force this on anyone。 We don't want to feel like there's。 some
    group of experts that are going， to come across the company and then say， oh，
    no， this is how。 you should do it。 We want teams to come to us。 We want them to
    feel like whatever we're doing is so valuable。 that they'll kind of reach across
    the company， say， hey， could you come and partner with us on this？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also make sure that we have really clear goals。 We want the software team。
    our Auxiliary Engineer， and the product owner to feel like they are aligned， on
    a common outcome。 That includes business objectives， but it also might include
    things like code coverage。 or some bringing in best practice， maybe black or automatic，
    linting pipelines， things like that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also do three month durations。 Now， yes， that conveniently fits into a quarter
    of time。 Maybe it makes planning easy。 But there's another reason that we do three
    months。 There's some research that shows that it takes about a bit， over two months
    to form a new habit。 And that's kind of what we feel like we're doing。 We're going
    to that team。 We're working with them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we're helping them build good habits。 And if we were to do this for a few
    weeks。 maybe we'd choose some of it。 But I have some concerns that once we leave。
    they're just going to reach for whatever feels most obvious， to them。 And those
    habits really aren't going to take。 So we spend a lot of time just reinforcing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and trying to make that what's second nature to us， second nature to the team。
    So during a project。 it's very important， very important that we are part of that
    team。 Not some outsider who's kind of like advising。 If we are in the team。 we
    are working towards the same goals。 We sit with the team。 We do meetings with
    the team。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We want to feel like we are a member of that team， throughout the project。 Also。
    we pair on the hard work。 We don't take it on ourselves。 That we absolutely do
    not want to go and solve， the hardest problem in a project ourselves。 because
    that robs the team of the ability to learn。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That robs them of the chance to understand really， why a particular solution
    was selected。 So it's important that whenever a hard project or a hard part， of
    the project shows up。 we pair with them。 We make sure that we're passing that
    knowledge on， to whoever else is involved。 We also focus a lot on feedback。 Feedback
    is very important to us。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we do weekly retros with the team， specifically on the Ox-Engine engagement，
    what's going well。 what's not going well。 We talk about the project。 We also talk
    about our role in the project。 Is it working？ Is it healthy？ And we want to get
    really good feedback。 We actually encourage teams to give us critical feedback。
    If something's not going right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we want to know that。 We want to address it。 Which leads well into the learning
    aspect of this。 And it really goes both ways。 It's not like we're bringing a whole
    bunch of knowledge。 as experts on to the team and taking nothing back ourselves。
    We get a lot of really good information from this。 And I say a lot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is impossible for us to know what， it's like to learn Python for the first
    time。 today or what it's like to use our platform for the first time。 But when
    we're sitting with people。 and we're watching them get confused because some documentation，
    wasn't clear。 it's extremely obvious。 And we also funnel that into 20% time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So anyone who's doing auxiliary engineering， gets one day a week to just take
    all of that information。 they got in the course of the week。 Maybe it was something
    that was unintuitive and address it。 It's completely self-directed。 Just take
    action。 There's no real process to go through。 Just work on improving the platform。
    We follow up six months later with the team。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Want to make sure that whatever knowledge that we brought in， actually stayed。
    And we're seeing that take hold。 And often case， that's what happens。 And actually
    even gets a little better than that。 We've done this about 10 projects。 A number
    of them， what we've observed， is not only does that team start to become strong。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but the teams adjacent to them start to become strong too。 They start to spread
    those best practices， that we try to spread。 And the idea of what Pythonics starts，
    to replicate across the company。 And it's really quite amazing。 There's also a
    really high demand for this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's not like we have to go and find teams to come and--， and they're like，
    hey， would you。 want to work with us on this？ No， we actually have to turn away
    people， unfortunately。 every time we go through a planning cycle。 Because there's
    just not enough engineers on the platform。 team to meet that demand。 So that's
    a really good indicator that what we're doing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is extremely valuable。 It's also led to a ton of platform improvements。 Being
    with the team。 seeing what was working well， and not working well， makes sure
    that we are not--， OK。 this is a clap。 I wasn't sure if you would tell me to cut
    off because of time。 OK。 so we've made a ton of platform improvements， just because
    there's a lot of good feedback in that process。

    Thank you。 Hi， everyone。 My name is Brianna Kaplan， and I'm， the founder of CodeRDreams。
    We're a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in Chicago。 We serve under-resourced high school students。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    change。 in our communities。 So I think we can all agree on two things this morning。
    Number one。 this is my dog Piper。 And we can all agree that she is super cute。
    But the second thing。 probably more importantly， is that computational thinking
    is important。 Teachers agree。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: According to a study by EdSurg， 88% of K through 12 teachers。 said that computer
    science is crucial to preparing students， for the workforce。 And as Pythonese
    says， we know that STEM education is more。 than just preparing students to become
    scientists， engineers， or mathematicians。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's just as important as a liberal arts education。 But the reality is， with
    the same study。 only 20% of students are actually being reached。 So there's a
    disconnect between the belief。 that computer science is important and the actual
    application， of these skills in schools。 So the problems， they can be put into
    four buckets。 The first two， lack of teachers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: lack of standardized curriculum。 Over half of public school districts in the
    nation。 report struggling to recruit and retain certified， and effective STEM
    teachers。 And this figure raises to 90% in districts serving。 large proportions
    of African-American and Hispanic students。 Number three and number four。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    it has the most unfair school funding system in the nation。 according to a study
    released by the Education Trust。 And in this study， individual schools。 were underfunded
    by $2。4 billion。 So I know you're all asking， what can we do？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We really need your help。 As a community， let's invest in the schools that have
    the least。 And this is why I started CodeR Dreams。 As I said， CodeR Dreams is
    a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in Chicago。 Every student cohort that we teach starts with
    the question， what communities are you a part of。 what makes them great， and beautiful，
    but also what problems do you see？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Our students ideate on applications， they can build that address some of those
    problems。 And then that's the applications that they， build throughout the year-long
    program。 They learn everything from ideation， to user experience and design， Python
    programming。 and the delivery of the product to showcase to their communities。
    And coming this fall。

- en: we'll have three different tracks--， data science， web development， and physical
    computing--。 offer social good。 So there are a few things that we're doing that
    we think。 are important and that are different。 So the first is that we think
    it's。 important to reach students where they are。 Nearly all of low-performing
    Chicago high schools。
  prefs: []

- en: are on the south side and sit on or border the poorest census， tracks。 However。
    the majority of STEM programming， occurs in the city center， which is inaccessible
    to the majority。 of students who need it the most。 It's really important that
    we meet the students where they are。 The second is focusing on schools that need
    it the most。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    where I live。 I can give two examples。 There is a school up north called Stevenson。
    That school has an Olympic-sized pool and espresso bar， two different gyms。 and
    theater performances。 Versus a school in Waukegan， which typically has 28 students。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: to just one computer and their band， plays in the hallway because they don't
    have enough space。 The third thing that we think is important， is exposing students
    to all opportunities in tech。 Our students have the opportunity， to take on the
    roles from product manager to product， designer。 programmer， sales， and marketing。
    Something in there will resonate with all students。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's get together and expose students， to everything within tech。 And lastly。
    I think it's important to empower students， to actually create the change that
    they seek to see。 Our students build applications that， make positive impact on
    their local communities。 And if you or your company is interested in sponsoring，

    result of the research。 I ran into this， and I like the idea of transforming，
    your world with the power of Python。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That seems like a good idea。 And the way this works in practice。 it's for the
    Java version of the thing。 And you take the Java version of the program。 you embed
    it in a server。 It exposes a Java-based plugin framework。 It's built for the Raspberry

    but what I really want to do， is I want to be able to respond to game events。

    things with it。 And anything else that you have this really rich API that， is

    with some， modern Python。 And it turns out there's a thing we can do。 We can write
    a web socket adapter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    So those folks have been doing a really good job， in getting an asynchronous client
    that works on that。 We can write something between--， I mean， it's big， it's so
    washer， I don't know。 And then you could write on that。 So the scope of the implementation

    of these Java API things。 And for the sake of actually making it easy to use，
    on the same level as my API， we need to Python。

    kind of like this。 We register a bunch of callbacks。 We can set blocks。 In this
    case。 the idea is to respond to a player moving， and sort of put a block behind
    them。 In other words。 Tron。 So you have some of these that sort of look like this。
    You've got the game。

    So Anthony and I。 we are here to talk about Call of Forge， a community pattern
    that works for you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And our actual talk is going to be about reinventing the wheel。 Funny thing。
    our first title was Beyond the Wheel， and then we realized that a better title
    would be working。 progress。 So just a little bit about Call of Forge before we
    go。 We tried to address all the package you need。 It's going to be a one-stop
    shop for all the platforms--。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Windows， Mac， Linux， ARM， R8 and 9， and no arch。 So if you have to support multiple
    platforms with a single tool。 and you need a lot of packages， call it， on the
    call of Forge， it's a tool for you。 Call of Forge is big， and it's growing more
    and more， every day， like we have more than 100。000 artifacts， totaling up to
    more than 450 gigabytes spread over 6，000， feedstocks with more than 1。

    4，000 pull requests。 and I believe we broke the record and did have for most--，
    the repository is the most sub-modules。 So but we're here to talk about wheels，
    and then I would like to introduce you， Condopress。 Condopress is a new tool that
    converts， condopecages to wheels。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can find it on the reorganization， Condopress。 It's a pretty new project。
    Condopress tries to address problems mixing people， in Condop， because that usually
    end up。 with all this ABI incompatibility。 So Oracle starts to fix that。 Some
    people may want to package with different builds， or newer ABIs than the main
    elements。 Like。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: for example， if you want to cancel flow with a different， like say， a little
    jusillip。 And Condop have a lot of packages that are not on wheels。

    enough to speak for the language， and do a demo。 I'm going to head over to Anthony，
