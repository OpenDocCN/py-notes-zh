    interested in it。 Only if you want to understand more about your own， and provide
    more。 Here or here or here。 I don't know how to say that。 I'm going to say that

    life， I think it's very interesting。 So， slide there is a friendly， you know，

    why this。 by the time he's covering something locked in it， so this is locked
    in there so that only one thing is actually at this。 and also at this point。 So，

    I was about seven years in his last year in New York where I went and I couldn't
    go to。 And that's just what happened， I was like， well， I've never been to a classroom

- en: but why may we want to go to the perfect frame？ I think， and hopefully in NASA，
    we'll be able to。 you know， about driving， and I will do the idea。 We'll be the
    only one driver。 and even if you come to the door and say， "I mean， you have no
    people driver available。 everybody's driving， I think， and I'll go to the parking

    I would be able to stay hours in New York， and you have to take time for a better
    time。 That's not a good thing， right？ For example， my community， of course， I
    can try this。 but you'll be better in， I think， for a better place。 I think it's

- en: I think， for even more， than you know， than you can even see。 So， maybe。 if
    this one driver is a perfect， and you can be more， than you can see， we give not
    to， you know。 if this one is a perfect， and then we can go to a very perfect，

    just， I think， in a very simple way。 about the funding that I'm going to build，
    part of it， so， you just need more， right。 because this challenges the longer
    we want to build， and we can make sure that we don't have。
  id: totrans-25

    in my opinion。 where we're still going to be， where it's not happening， but， in
    my opinion。 I'm going to say something in my own opinion， so， I think， for a little
    bit， we're not going to be。 you know， someone who wants to do this， And so in
