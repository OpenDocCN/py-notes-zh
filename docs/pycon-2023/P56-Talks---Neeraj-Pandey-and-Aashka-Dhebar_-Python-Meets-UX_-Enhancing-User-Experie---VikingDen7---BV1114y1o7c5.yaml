    of AI and the user experience。 So we don't have to discover the power we can use
    by contrast。 It's like all the power of the AI。 And we're going to be able to
    use it。 For the presentation。 we'll be discussing the importance of user experience。

    in the context of the product， we can be incorporated on those aspects。 Including
    data management and data management。 Optimization of the organization for any
    product。 So to begin with， we see the importance of UX。 Because UX is very crucial
    in trying to understand user needs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Making the product more personalized。 And also， the users can use the cut-off
    for the organization for the companies。 And also， who can retain the users。 So
    to begin with， we need to understand the process。 I put the process from the UX
    to standard。 And also， it's going to be a good day in life。 So we've partnered
    our digital process where all the information is still gathered。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from different product resources。 We're going to do it into the task or something。
    And then once we have a lot of data with us， we can define the product for any
    business。 So we have a concrete example now that we need to solve a problem in
    this first part。 We need to project a mission for this engine。 So then we go to
    the ideas we've created。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We just want to know， you know， two-member things right。 But the UX is done。
    And it's continuously spinning over different kinds of operations。 So the product
    then can use some sort of construction。 And then the architectural product also
    comes out of both。 But if I make a cure， a dollar product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then then the benefit will be the users are the users， who can be able to make
    a difference。 So if we go out and take a new API and do it， then we're going to
    see that there is a common。 frame between new and new UX support， go with that
    information and the information in this product。 So we can see that there's more
    than something that we often supervise and use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have more than something else， but we have more than something else。 But
    we have more than something else。 And when it's new。 it's quite difficult to know
    that the person is coming up to the product。 and the person is possibly getting
    information from the site。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All these beyond what is being discussed in those things can be written in the
    product in minutes and so。 So with the conversation， we can make more user-funded
    product。 And we can make personal lives for the specific user。 So the people might
    argue and tell this to the person， we can start working the processing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we can make the right audio， we can hear the staff that is going to send
    everybody's UX processes。 to the site， so it's very crucial。 There's a cloud that
    identifies the site about a specific user。 and how they are going to do the product
    and their feedback。 And then we can use this to start using the case in a particular
    instance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is a knowledge of people's assumptions， they are not going to be in discussions。
    But the people who used to use this site for the community。 who used to find a
    specific tool to explain all those two other rights from processes in different
    sites。 So I'm taking the rights， but the rights is something that's been done
    for my particular site。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we don't call themselves by thinking about the common features。 For users
    who are part of the product to do it， and they use the same size for someone who's
    for other users。 So the second thing that person used to do is to have these things
    in the user。 part of these things that wouldn't use as part of the member pattern。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we can use those different seminars and some of the details to figure out。
    those patterns and then the differences within the community program。 And for
    example。 with the experience of data， it's hard for us to conduct the data in
    the patterns of the user。 And then we can write this， and then we can use the
    knowledge of how the users are moving to your product。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then we can do some different things that are like how the data pattern
    is required。 and how we can invent。 And then we can do some different things。
    So， yes， but can I say， you know。 whatever the ones that are human， so that's
    not a problem。 Just because you may see that there are a couple of people in the
    world。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    in the world。 or in the community， and you can ask them to do it in the community。
    And all the work for those who have been back to go without the disability。 and
    those who have really used the data， you know。
  prefs: []

    to find out how to use products， because they can be utilized to the cater body。

    a product that we can say that， if you look at the users， you need it。 and one
    who wants to go with the community， because you don't want to be easily a product。
    and if you're starting to get to a person like you， and then， you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    who need the product， and they do a work for it， because they're going through
    the things。 that they're thinking about， or it is quickly being like， "Oh。 there's
    a person who needs the users to ask them what they're doing。"， So， for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and it's not here。"， And we're just like the topics that we've built that are
    called， and says， "Oh。 we heard that this is still the place we're going through。
    and we used to talk about what we're going through today， and you don't use customers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    not the place we're going through today。"， So。 we think there's a lot of people
    who can understand this， so。 we don't care if we're going through this product，
    and it's not the place we're going through。
  prefs: []

  prefs: []
