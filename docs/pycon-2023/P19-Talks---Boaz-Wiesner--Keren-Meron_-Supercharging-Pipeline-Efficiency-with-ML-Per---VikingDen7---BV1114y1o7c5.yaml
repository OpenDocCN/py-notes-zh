    then you can see the results。 Well， you can tell me if you follow almost the statement。

    we believe in final and then what it does。 So tonight， I think， to be example。

  prefs: []

    the process of number of 10。 So， now， we will remember the points in this example。
    This is why we talked about the things that we have learned around the time。 We
    also have the combination of the time that you're thinking。 And in this way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to think about doing any work of the time。 but this is still time for thinking
    that it builds the time that you're thinking about。 So。 we're essentially telling
    you to explore how to think for the model。 and not really remember the context。
    The first thing we do is we will also make decisions of the time and do。
  prefs: []

    remember the answer to that， you can say that you're gonna remember the number
    of the time that you're gonna remember。 And then， that's why we're getting a new
    link to it once we leave it to both。 So， next。 we go to the next model。 In fact，
    we can also try to kind of slide in and tell you how to expand our。
  prefs: []

    remember。 we're going to call it the $1，000， or we can also have $1，000 in the
    report to the $1，000。 And if we're doing operations and things like that， we can
    do something like that。 so we're going to think about something to slide in and
    do。 So， finally。

    in the letter。
  prefs: []

    to help us to understand the model。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Cool。 41， that's so awesome。 That's kind of cool。 I know， and the first thing
    is， most important。 is that， when I do a model， that is a big model。 This is incredibly
    innovative。 and I just want to add all of it， because that's just really throwing
    down all of our tests。 That is our entire training of the test for any of the
    structures that has to happen in the test for instance。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and this is from a very different problem。 And we're looking at this。 I have
    to have two theory of a graph。 I'm going to work with them， and check those tests。
    So。 the first thing happens is that we need to have these stories passed。 We have
    a project called a test in particular， and it's just a complex thing called a
    test。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is a simple， complex thing called a test。 That was a relevant metadata for
    the test。 It is like the duration or memory。 This is what the actual data used
    to say。 So， then。 it takes that idea， and it takes it to something like three。
    It takes everybody that's an object for it。 And this also has an example called
    a test in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It allows you to use a test while clearing， and run while clearing over data。
    so you can see it's a test。 And when you go right back。 you might not be able
    to make it to people who are looking for a test。 And it's only predicted to be
    a runner。 This is a story test that we run。

    is a responsible for actually three of them， including the model。 And the way
    that it works is that first， it's clear it is to find a three-inch user。 And it's
    clear that it's a good step for a test and build a data set out of it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But then it takes the existing model and takes the new data。 and it brings the
    new model and you have all the updated information。 So， in each way。 it's something
    changes or something that becomes heavier instead of white。 then it takes a couple
    of things to run a test for a lot of things。 Now， finally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    model and two years later。 And it's a smaller procedure。 Then a materialized model。
    which is pretty small， and actually straight into the value of a product。 So you
    can see the key。 the key that you customize in it， and the value that you make
    higher scale and like models。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the last thing to look at is the salary value。 The following value is the bid
    of salary code that runs every time that I'm going to have to receive。 And the
    price of the price， the credit card， the credit card， the value that you have。
    And then zero-filtration code there， but all it does is just the card。 It takes
    the customer out of the test， takes the model from right。 And runs the test。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    right cost by the right is $10。50。 And the right key is the right key， or the

    all the specific links and model models， we'll be able to make sure that they're
