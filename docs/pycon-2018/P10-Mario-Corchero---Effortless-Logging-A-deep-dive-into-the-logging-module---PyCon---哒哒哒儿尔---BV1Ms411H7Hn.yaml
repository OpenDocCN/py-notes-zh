    me afterwards and speak about more logging。 or anything related to Python or traveling
    to Spain， if you''re planning some holidays。'

    oh， my God。 this is one of those slides where maybe the topic is interesting，
    but it's all going。 to be about how happy Mario said Bloomberg that they are recruiting
    in London， New York。 San Francisco， many other places。 The company is great， great
    benefits， but I'm not going。

    is important。 how logging works， how can we use it， how to configure it。 We'll
    try to see some code。 and then some sample recipes。 I'm going to have to flash
    through the slides because。 I just rehearsed it and I don't have much time。 So
    first of all， it's why logging。 And I like。

    because you。 realize the issue that when people read your code， that it's not
    you， have to understand。 what you wrote， but you also need to realize that when
    your code is running in production。 as a black box， people are going to see your
    code when you are away on holidays on Spain。

- en: as we're going to discuss afterwards。 And you don't want them to call you because
    they。 are not able to figure out what's going on， right？ And logging and instrumentation
    is。 what it does for you。 It allows you to see what application is doing when
    it's running。 So I like to see that some kind of documentation for developers
    and CSAT means when things are。

    if you use。 a debugger in development， you are doing it wrong because they say
    that if you are not。 able to reason about your program on your development environment，
    just with the logs。 how are you going to be able to do it in production？ I'm not
    one of those。 I can't still use the。

    in such a way that I deal with what I'm just running the test。 If I see the logs，
    I will。 be able to understand what's the issue behind it。 So you would say， yeah，

    just print whatever。 I want。 Print is not -- you want to use the right tool for
    the right job。 Logging has many。 features that you won't get out of print。 First
    of all， logging allows for multi-threading。 If you are printing things around
    multiple threads， everything is going to collide。 It's。

- en: more flexible。 You can categorize your logs as we're going to see in a minute。
    For me。 the most beautiful thing is the design of logging。 It allows you to split
    the how from， the what。 What I mean is logging has this kind of collaborative
    approach that it allows you， to say。 what do you want to log without worrying
    about how is it going to be logged？ What do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I mean for this is if you are writing a library， you can instrument it with
    logs and the person。 that's going to use the library in application can worry
    about how those are going to be treated。 First of all， I've seen this picture
    on every good speaker's presentation。 I don't know if。

- en: class。 The logger class is the main class that you interact with。 When you're
    writing a Python。 program， you take a logger， you call one of the methods that
    you have and pass a string。 template and the arguments to it。 This thing goes
    into the logger code and it appears whatever。 you want。 It's not really like that。
    The first thing that's going to happen is that the logger。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is going to create a log record that contains not only the template and the
    message that。 you have but also context about where this is being logged。 Once
    that's done， we know。 that that object cannot magically go to your console。 What's
    going to happen is that a。 handler -- sorry， this way。 A handler would take your
    log record and put it into a stream。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like a CDL or a file or an email or whatever you want。 There are multiple handles
    in the。 standard library that can take your records and put it on whatever destination。
    If you haven't。 checked them out， I invite you to do it because there are some
    that are really， really cool。 Like for example， you can send ELOX via HTTP with
    an already pre-built handler that is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in the standard library。 That's what we discussed。 Now we have the logger that
    takes this kind。 of message。 It goes into the code of the logger， then it creates
    a record and then it takes。 the record to the handler and it appears。 That's all
    good。 But you might be wondering。 that log record is an object。 So how is that
    object being transformed into a string when。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm logged into a console？ Even if you have this three handler that we spoke
    about with。 this file handler， all these kind of handlers that at the end just
    output strings， all that。 code needs to be shared somewhere。 That's what the formatter
    comes in。 Formatter will。 just take this log record and transform it into a string。
    We understand logging now， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we have a logger which takes a string。 It goes through the logger code。 It
    meets a log， record。 but by sending it to the handler， and the handler is going
    to format the string。 Everyone understands logging now， right？ It's really simple。
    There's one more thing that。 we want to introduce。 So there's also filters。 They
    just allow you to filter logs on more。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like fine-tuned characteristics。 So it's basically a class where you can decide
    whether based。 on any character of the log record whether you want to let it pass
    or not。 Okay。 We have。 the whole stack now。 So a logger takes a string。 Well，
    at the template and the parameters go。 through the logger code。 Filters might
    allow it to pass or not。 We're going to emit it in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the handler。 The handler is going to format it。 There's also filters in the
    handler， and。 if all of that works， and now we're going to have our beautiful
    log printed into the console。 or whatever script we have。 Not that totally simple。
    We have also a logger hierarchy。 I know。 this is starting to get complicated，
    but we are going to go a little bit later on that， way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So now there's the logging hierarchy。 Whenever you create a logger， you have
    this。 function that will retrieve a logger with the string separated tokens that
    you pass on it。 So here。 and this will create a hierarchy for you。 So here basically
    what we are saying。 is we want to get the logger parent child， and that logger
    is a child of parent which at。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the same time is a child of the root logger that all loggers inherit from。 You
    can see。 it kind of the， like the， you can see the root logger like object， okay，
    on Python 3。 But don't worry， you don't need to land MRO。 There's no multiple
    inheritance here。 Okay。 So this is complex， but now we get it。 So we said we have
    a logger， takes the template。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: takes some parameter， then we have the filter， we are going to meet in a lot
    of law， we formatted。 but we're going to do the same thing again。 And now if the
    logger has this attribute called。 propagate set to true， which is the default，
    it's going to meet it to all the party handler。 And now this is really important。
    This is what confuses a lot of people when using logins， tag。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it's that when you have parent loggers， parent loggers， the code that is
    shared is。 the call to the handlers。 Okay。 So what I mean is once the， once a
    logger is done processing， well。 when a， when a logger has called all the handler
    that it has， it's not going to。 call the parent logger， it's going to call the
    parent handlers。 So it's going to call。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the handlers of his parent logger。 So the filter code， for example， won't be
    executed。 Okay。 This was complex。 We do now know how logging works， right？ Now，
    now， okay， some， more things。 So loggers also have a category and a navel and
    some of the attributes that。 will control some of the particularities of your
    logs and how they travel through the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: logging stack。 Basically， category on both logger and handler will allow you
    to set a threshold。 on both of them。 So for example， if a logger has a category
    of warning， it will only log， warning。 and above log records。 And now you might
    be wondering， like， what happens if。 the parent logger has a level of error only，
    but the child one has info？ So because as， we said。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: only the， the parent handlers code is the one that is being executed on the，
    parent。 That won't be an issue。 But we'll， we'll， we'll see that in more details
    on， all of the。 on all of the slides。 I don't want to make， make， make some of
    the things。 Now with all that。 this is the actual， this is the actual diagram
    that you have in the， documentation of Python。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Actually， this whole talk came because the first time I saw this， slide， it
    was， I was like， yeah。 this is correct， but I have no idea how to， I mean， I know
    how， to read this， but it's super hard。 right？ If you have no context about how
    logging works， this is great。 then you can follow the diagram， but it's really
    hard to reason about logging。 Okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we have wind scene logging， let's see， let's see now how， how can we use
    those， those loggers？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is an example on how to use logging。 And you can see that we are， getting
    here a logger。 we are logging on the bug， and some interesting things are， for
    example， here we see， we see x info。 This is， if you are on stack， if you are
    in an exception scope。 this is going to log not only your message， but it's also
    going to log the exception。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that you are being handling。 This is super useful。 At the same time， we spoke
    about the。 the levels that logger have， like the bug info warning error and critical，
    and exception。 is not a new level。 It's just error level with x， with x info to
    true。 If you want to， log this。 the stack information outside of an exception，
    you also have this new parameter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: called stacking for that you can use。 Okay。 So now， I'm going to， I'm going
    to show you。 some issues that I was doing at the beginning， where I was recently
    logging without reader。 documentation， and I'm only， I'm the only one that does
    this。 I'm not all of you read。 the documentation before using any library， right？
    But I didn't， and these are some things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that I realized that I wanted to do different from the way I was using it。 So
    first of all， is。 well， disclaimer， this can start flame wars bigger than space
    versus tabs。 Okay。 But basically。 I used to do format on the message and just
    pass a string to the logger。 Ideally， what。 you want to do is this。 Some people
    will claim that this can， this can cause what's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: called a hasten bug， because if it depends on how you logging configuration
    is， is the。 only application you may see a narrow note at the time that you are，
    that you are like。 printing this message。 But being realistic， I think this is，
    this is， this is a much better。 way to pass a message。 And this is actually now
    an error on pilot， even if pilot is opinionated。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that hey。 Next thing is this。 How many times have you seen this beautiful exception
    where。 it says a terrible error will happen？ Data。 And the problem is that what
    you want to do。 is this to see the whole exception， because if you do this and
    you get a key error， what。 you're going to get is the string representation of
    a key error。 And the string representation。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of a key error is the key error that you're missing。 So if in your tribe log
    you are doing。 a lot of access to dictionaries， you're going to get a really meaningful
    data， right？ How。 beautiful is that？ So just use x info and you'll get the whole
    stack and line and the type。 of exception of what happened。 If you want to create
    your own logger hierarchy， you can， do it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in some situation that's useful， but most of the time what you want to do
    is。 to link your log hierarchy with your folder naming。 This will make， for example，
    if you're。 working in library requests， but just doing that， all your logs in
    all your files that。 you have requests will have the parent log of requests。 So
    this is like super handy。 And。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you don't have to think about naming， which is the biggest issue in computer
    science。 So we know how to use it， but how do we configure this？ We spoke about
    this beautiful design。 on logging where you can write code that uses logging and
    then on a totally separate space。 you're going to configure how that works。 So
    we're going to see that。 And there are three。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: main ways to configure it。 You can configure it by writing code。 You can use
    an init file。 or you can configure it with a dictionary。 So first of all， you
    can plug everything together。 or you can use for really simple scripts and things
    like that。 You can use basic config。 It just has some kind of a list of same defaults
    for scripts and things like that。 It will。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just log to std error。 And it would， this is exactly the function that will
    be called。 if you start to use logging without having to configure it。 It has
    a lot of parameters。 so with basic config， you can， for example， start logging
    to a file instead of a std error。 And you can set the level， format， and many
    other things。 You can check documentation。 Then。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is probably the most interesting one， like configuring from a dictionary。
    When you。 configure for a dictionary， you're just going to list all the components
    that we explained， before。 So， for example， here we can see that we have plugins，
    logger and the root logger。 being configured to this one only to error level and
    this one to console level。 So you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can see the plugins logger doesn't have any handler， but that's not an issue
    because it's。 going to use the handler of the parents。 And oh， and if you wondered，
    yeah， you can also。 configure the logging with an in-file， but I don't like it，
    so I'm not going to present， it。 If you want to configure it from a file， you
    say， "YAML file，" and then use the dict， one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which is much more powerful。 And now we're going to see how this code goes through
    the。 logging code of the Sunday library。 Something I really like about logging
    is that the code。 if you understand all the design decisions that are around logging，
    the code is really。 easy to follow。 So if you have an issue with logging or you
    don't understand nothing， you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can use it on this time something。 You can just literally open the code with
    many other Python。 modules and read and see what's going on。 Anyway， we are going
    to see what this line。 is going to be doing。 So first of all， is the blue okay？
    Can you read？ Okay。 So don't。

- en: worry， that's just a string。 So basically， this is the info method of a logger。
    And I。 think that's -- you can see the first thing that is doing is going to check
    if this logger。 is enabled for the category that we are trying to log， which is
    info。 If that's the case， then。 it's going to call this underscore log method，
    which we can see here。 It's huge。 Here you。

    you can see。 that we are building this here in red， which is also not really great。
    We are building this。 log record that we spoke about。 And it doesn't have just
    the message and the arcs that is。 what we provided， but it has all kind of all
    the set of information that is collected around。

- en: the function that you are using。 Once that's done， we are going to call handle
    in the logger， yet。 okay？ And the things that handler is going to do is it's going
    to check if the， logger is enabled。 And if the logger is enabled and the filter
    is going to go through， then。 it's going to call the handlers， steal the code
    of the logger。 So here we're still in。

- en: the call of the logger。 This is， I think it's like the main bulk of logging
    that you're interested。 on。 And what this is doing is， well， if I cannot read
    what's here， I don't know how， can you do it。 So what you can see here is that
    C is the current logger， and then it's。 going to go for each of the loggers， it's
    going to go through all the handlers that the logger。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: has and check the level and then send the log to the handler。 Once it's done
    with all， the handlers。 you can see here that if propagate is set to true， if，
    so if propagate is set， to true。 it's going to take the parent logger and then
    call all the handlers above。 As you， can see。 this is what I was speaking about
    before that a logger doesn't call the parent， logger。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It just calls the handlers of all the parents。 That's really， that's for me，
    at least。 it was one of the most confusing things。 The other thing that a parent
    logger used for is。 that if a logger doesn't have a log level set， it's going
    to try to get the level from the。 parent and the rigoratively。 That's what the
    hierarchy is useful。 Now， once you're done， here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    application。 in Flask on， on some kind of web server， you can， you can use filters，
    you can abuse of。 filters to add some kind of contextual information like a correlation
    ID。 And that will allow。 you to， if you are using Splunk for example， and there
    is an error， you can get that correlation。
  prefs: []

    3。4 I think， you have。 if you are lucky to be doing Python 3。6， we hope， I hope
    you do。 You can use a。 new factory method in the login stack that also can do
    the same thing。 Money is much cleaner。 Although this is actually one of the way
    that is recommended but nowadays it's much better。

- en: to the factory。 This is really cool。 So your application is really verbose and
    it has some。 info logs that are okay but you only want to see those info logs
    whenever there is an， error。 By just doing this kind of buffering handler， what
    you are doing is that you will。 see the info logs only one， like you will see
    for example， you can configure it to three。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    imagine。 Okay。 So what happens。 one of the issues of logging is whenever you log
    something that's going to block and tell。 all that machinery that we saw is going
    to be done。 This means that if you are sending， an email。

- en: if you have an SMTP handler that will send you an email， that line is going。
    to block until the limit is done。 So you can also use a queue handler which basically
    allows。 you to queue your log to be handled in a different way， in a different
    place。 Now the concept。 of log record that we spoke about is key here because
    we built a log record before the code。

    at the time you。 create the log and not at the time that you emitted。 Sorry。 Oh，
    you have found this super， useful。 So if you are creating a CLI tool and you want
    as many Unix tools to log for example。 warning and above to STD error and info
    and below to STD out， you can use this small， this。

- en: So now we have time for questions， right？ That's my guinea pig。 It's the need
    of my scene。 Okay。 For the questions， there's a mic up front if anybody has any。
    Hey， I have a question。 So say I'm developing a library and I want to use logging，
    right？ But I don't want to。 presume what my users might configure， how my users
    might configure the logging module。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How should I go about doing that？ Do I just call the module， get the logger
    for the module。 name and then log to that and leave it on them？ Or what do I do？
    Yeah。 So my advice would be that you log as you think that it's useful for your
    users。 in the sense of you want to log the information that will help them travel
    to the issues。 And。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: something really important that I see a lot is don't log errors on your library。
    If there。 is an error in your library and you're going to throw an exception，
    don't log it as well。 Because it can happen that your client might want to just
    capture the exception and ignore， it。 And if you are logging an error， then you
    are forcing them to put a higher threshold。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on your library。 That makes sense？ Hello。 I have a question about multiple inheritance。
    You mentioned at the beginning that there， is no such thing and it actually disappoints
    a little。 So is there any way to implement， multiple inheritance in case I have
    some specific logger but I use it in different models and。 I want to have the
    same config， the same logger？ Yes。 So the only thing you can do。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so the only thing that's shared across logger by inheritance， is as we said。
    the level that's going to take by default if no one is set and the handler， that
    it had。 So usually what you would see is that multiple loggers， I've seen situations，
    like that。 you'll see that multiple loggers will just have the same list of handlers。
    And， because the code of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know， the configuration code is actually in the handler， it's just， fine
    to list them as a list。 I don't know if I explain it too well。 Yeah。 I think I
    understood。 Thank you。 One last question。 After that， like， here， Mario will be
    outside。 Yeah。 Okay。 It was a great talk。 Do you have any suggestions how to do
    logging in multiple， processing with multiple processes？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are some particular issues there。 Yeah。 So that's actually quite tricky。
    So the problem when you have， like， if you fork， if you have multiple processes。
    the problem is that you cannot have multiple processes。 log in into the same file
    because everything will get messed up。 So the useful suggestion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there is to use a queue handler as we saw before and then have a single process
    doing。 all the logging。 So basically you'll have， you know， when you fork and
    everything， that。 queue will have the two ends and then you just in queue all
    the logs and a single process。 will do all the processing and there won't be any
    issue。 Thank you。 We're done for the session。
