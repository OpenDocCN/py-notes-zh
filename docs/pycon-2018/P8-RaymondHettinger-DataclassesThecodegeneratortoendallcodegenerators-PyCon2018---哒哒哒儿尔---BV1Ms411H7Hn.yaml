    So hello。 my name is Eric Smith， it's nice to meet you。 Usually when I stand up
    and talk。 I talk about something I wrote。 But now I'm talking about something
    that other people wrote and did a fantastic job at。 And I get to be the vehicle
    who hopefully does justice to their creation。

    about together。 What does this mean for us？ What does it do？ So I'd like this
    to be a thinking exercise for us as we look at it。 I'd like it to be a tutorial
    and I'd like my slides for you to be a recipe book of how to use it to a great
    effect。 So without further ado， let's see anything on this page。 Interesting。

- en: Rebuilding slides on stage。 All right。 So the title of the talk is the Code
    Generator to Endol- Code Generators。 What does the Code Generator do for you？
    You give it a list of specifications and it writes code for you。 Is that good？
    If your specifications are good and the code it generates is what you want。 then
    it's good。 If your specifications are bad， probably not going to work out so well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the Code Generator does something different than what you expect it's going
    to do， not so well。 So when you work with Code Generators， your goal is to be
    in harmony with the Code Generator and think about its worldview。 because it's
    going to write code on your behalf。 In theory， you're unit testing everything
    you do。 but people tend to miss a fair number of cases that are covered well by
    this tool。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it helps to really become one with this tool。 One of the things I'd like
    to name tuples is they have a near zero learning curve。 On the other hand， they
    had very limited capabilities。 So this is exactly the opposite situation。 The
    data classes module is the amount of code is several times larger than that for
    named tuples。 But it provides a much richer set of functionality。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which means it's kind of an entire ecosystem of tools that are worked together
    in tools and possibilities。 One of the things that I really like were some excellent
    design choices were made so that right out of the box。 if you use it in the simplest
    possible way， it mostly does for you what you want it to do most of the time。
    But then it grows with you as you start to have more exotic needs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So why do we want a Code Generator？ Because it can save you time。 the time you
    would have spent writing that code is paid back right away。 Also。 Code Generators
    reduce wordiness。 A lot of Python classes， when people first learn Python。 they
    feel like there's a lot of boilerplate in there。 Writing the repper， writing the
    dunder in it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: writing a dunder EQ， writing a dunder hash， etc。 And that feeling of boilerplate
    never really goes away。 You get used to knocking out that code quickly， but you
    feel like that code isn't contributing the expression of your business logic。
    The idea of this Code Generator is to get you past that step。 Next question is
    what are data classes for？ It depends on who you ask。 There are two world views。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and of those two world views， the people who see it one way don't tend to see
    it another。 Those people who think data classes are primarily about data， which
    means I need a holder for data。 I need an aggregate data structure， something
    like a struct in another language。 If that is your world view， data classes support
    that world view。 They are data holders。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But there's another world view that says I spend a lot of time writing classes
    putting interesting functionality in it。 and I'd like the boilerplate to go away
    so I could focus on the business logic。 If you think of it as a tool to help you
    write classes and you're going to write lots of methods anyway。 it just takes
    out the boilerplate for you， data classes are for you as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The word data in data classes has to do with it being a data holder。 and the
    classes part has to do with it as a class generator。 It is both things。 and it
    means different things to different people at different times。 I'd like this to
    be a joint thinking exercise together for us to explore this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and instead of me just putting in one way give you information。 I would like
    you to assess each piece as it comes to you。 Here's what to think about。 One of
    the things you want to learn is how to use the code generator。 Also。 when you
    use a code generator， the most critical thing to know is what code it writes for
    you。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the things that I really liked about name tuples， one of what I thought
    was a best feature。 was it had a verbose option， and when you used a name tuple
    it showed you the code that it wrote for you。 A benefit for that is no one ever
    had a question what code was written for me， ever。 On the other hand， no one has
    ever said anything nice to me about that feature ever。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Eric didn't copy that into data classes， and I took it out in Python 3。7。 so
    you no longer get to see the code that's generated unless you come to this talk。
    If you don't say that you like something it might disappear someday。 Alright。
    so what code does it write for you？ And the next question， even more important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: once you know what code it writes to you， is that what you really wanted？ Sometimes
    yes。 sometimes no。 This is a somewhat opinionated data structure。 and it has some
    opinions that I really like， but they may not reflect your worldview at all。 And
    then any tool you essentially have to ask the question。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: is the time spent invested learning the tool， teaching other people to use it
    and to read it。 is that worth the time that it saved you？ Some tools have an increase
    in complexity。 some have a net decrease in complexity， and like a rainbow， each
    person sees their own rainbow。 And whether this tool is beneficial for you or
    not， very much depends on your point of view。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One challenge for me is I train lots of people， enormous numbers of people to
    use Python。 And these folks benefit a great deal by having the classes completely
    spelled out so that they can learn how Python operates。 the language teaches you
    what it does。 On the other hand， when they need to do it on their own。 they often
    don't do it well and leave parts out。 So if I introduce data classes to them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on the one hand， the likelihood of them doing it correctly the first time is
    very high。 On the other hand， the likelihood of them understanding what happens
    behind the scene goes down。 Imagine a world where you have used Python classes
    and have never written a dunder in it yourself。 never written a dunder hash， never
    written a dunder repper。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: How would you even begin to comprehend this tool？ It is possible in an organization
    that if you adopt this tool wholesale。 all of the examples in the code won't have
    dunder in it's dunder reppers， dunder hash。 and so there's nothing to teach the
    users about what it does。 On the other hand。 education problems are problems that
    are easy to solve。 Have a tech talk for lunch。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: take a look at this tutorial and it will show you the code。 So if the engineering
    problem is we don't know something， the solution is just teaching it。 But I can't
    see in advance how it's going to work out in your world。 And also。 we have this
    realization that while it's nice to have a code generator saving its time writing
    code。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we spend more time reading and debugging code than we spend writing code。 So
    a question you want to ask yourself is this improve your debugging experience
    or does it make it worse？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the one hand， any tool that introduces an abstraction makes debugging worse
    because it hides something behind the abstraction。 On the other hand， if it automatically
    does a lot of things correctly for you and it's a well tested tool。 as this one
    is， usually your bug is somewhere else。 so it precludes those bugs being there
    to begin with。 But again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether this is a net win for you or not really depends on your world view and
    what you're doing with it at the time。 So these are the questions you should ask
    yourself as it's coming up。 So I'm going to do something terrible here which is
    to quickly recount the history beginning up。 going up to the creation of data
    classes。 I've got Eric。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the creator of the tool here to correct me on any of this。 but this is a dangerous
    undertaking because the last time I did it。 I left someone out and they were quite
    angry about it。 So they are now included in this one。 That said， history is quite
    difficult because there are very few new ideas under the sun。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every time we think we've done something original。 you don't have to look too
    far back in time to where someone else had the same problem and came up with the
    solution。 This might be the first time all the pieces were put together。 So in
    a very brief history of time。 probably omitting some people， in the beginning，
    there were dicks， tuples and handwritten classes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We used Dickshires for lookups， tuples for structures and handwritten classes
    when we wanted more functionality and the world was just fine。 Later， we added
    a code generator for you， named tuples。 It wrote some code for you that essentially
    its goal was to take a tuple and add names to the fields。 To this end， it succeeded。
    However， if you wanted something else。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like not having a tuple underneath the hood， of course it didn't work too well
    for you because it's a named tuple。 If you hate tuples， then you're not going
    to like named tuple as well。 Tuples being un-mutable。 being un-packable， being
    hashable might be things that you want or might not。 Later。 we got something called
    type simple namespace， which is just a very quick way to make a data holder。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As far as being a code generator， it generates very， very little for you。 but
    a lot of people really like it because it's so lightweight。 On the opposite end
    of the lightweight scale， we had ORMs， things like Django， SQL， Alchemy， PWE。
    As far as I know， these were the tools that pioneered using field specifications
    to generate more complex data structures behind the scene。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I know ORM being something， you make a class with field specifications and it
    generates the database behind the scenes for you。 That's fantastic。 Another tool
    that is very old and famous in the Python world is the Traitlets module。 Traitlets
    was all about validating data as it came in。 Traitlets was well-loved。 not as
    popular as some of these new tools， but it was very good at its job。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It pioneered the idea of using class variables for specifications of what should
    go in data or whatnot。 In the past few versions of Python， we've gone through
    this evolution of adding type annotations to the language。 First， we just had
    a notation for attaching it directly to a function or a class。 In it was inert。
    It didn't do anything。 Later， we got the typing module and third-party tools like
    MyPy that could scan all of the types and perform static typing checking for you。

- en: He used the number of degrees on the color wheel。 Saturation and lightness are
    typically expressed as a floating point number percentage of a saturation。 So
    the way you make that using a data class is you use a class decorator at data
    class。 You write a normal class。 You use that notation created by Lisa and our
    quido to indicate that。 hue is an integer。 And saturation is a float。 One really
    nice thing is you can specify default value for the float。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    And these three lines are exactly the same as these three lines。 So the only part

    tuple。 So do they look very structurally very similar to each other？

    you how it was made and it gives you a self-explanatory look。 This greatly helps
    during debugging。 Also， it lets you access the fields by name。 This is really
    nice。 If you've ever worked with straight tuples and have to refer to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: square brackets three or square brackets zero， you'll find that this is a great
    improvement。 Can you build one of them off of another？ There's a function called
    replace that takes in a instance of a data class。 and lets you replace one or
    more fields。 This says model off of one color and make another color。 This color
    has the same saturation and lightness but a different hue。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we're just spinning it around the color wheel。 So we also have the ability
    to turn it into a regular dictionary。 This is important。 Conceptually， anything

    thing is ordered like a tuple and once in a while you're going to want to unpack

    the methods start with an underscore。 I regret this choice。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I wish I had still used an underscore but a trailing underscore。 But because
    this has a stretch。 a strong hint that it's a private method。 It's not private
    at all。 It was just put in there to prevent a namespace conflicts with actual
    fields named a replace。 So this is not pretty but it does have an advantage。 It's
    discoverable。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you do a dir of the object， you'll see this method。 But if you do a dir of
    the data class。 you won't see the functions that operate on it at all。 This is
    a normal relationship between objects and our methods and functions。 So as dict
    is also a method and here's a difference， it returns an ordered dict。
  prefs: []

    chance that people rely on it being an ordered dict。 So I'm going to have to go
    through a deprecation cycle before I can actually switch this to a regular dict。
    So in this case， data classes will lead us because they don't have any legacy
    code to model after。 And if you want to turn something into a tuple， it's the
    same way as you turn it into a list。

    data classes don't have。 They unpack。 Can you do that with data classes？ The answer
    is yes but you have to first wrap this in a call to as tuple。 Which is a quite
    reasonable thing unless you're going to be doing this a lot。 If we check the size
    of this instance， it's significantly smaller， only 72 bytes versus the 168。

- en: So let's see what we get。 Like name tuples， it gives you a nice doc string。
    In fact。 the same doc string。 I really like that it's under init。 It has a type
    annotations built directly inside so it's introspectable。 It has a nice wrapper
    and the wrapper is exactly what you would write by a hand except that a lot of
    people would leave off a dull name。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is a case of the generated code being nicer than what most people would
    write by hand。 It's incorporating a best practice for you。 The equal method is
    really interesting。 What name tuples would do is this comparison here on the second
    line。 It's what most classes would do。 This one is somewhat interesting though。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It checks to see if the other method is of the other object is of the same class。
    So it refuses to compare apples to oranges。 This gives us a much stronger relationship
    between types。 It's something that I wish had been done for enums because it is
    possible now for us to have the enum color red equal one be equal to an enum size
    small。 medium and large where small is one。 And of course those things should
    be non-comparable and so this best practice is built into data classes by default。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I think this is a really nice win。 It's something most people wouldn't think
    to do but it will improve code quality and help you avoid some really hard to
    find bugs。 Another thing that people commonly forget is whenever you write an
    equality method you also need to say something about hashing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so this makes a fairly bold statement。 I'm not hashable at all。 What would
    happen if this were left out？ It would hash but it would compare on identity。
    And for a lot of people that is a surprise and it's rarely what you want。 So once
    again data classes are making a choice for you that is mostly what you want most
    of the time whether you knew it or not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It wrote about nine lines of code or ten lines of code。 So there's about a six
    line of code savings but along the way it improved quality by doing things that
    other people forget。 By making a tighter checks， making a higher quality repper
    and adding type annotations which are things that will forget。 So I think of the
    win in terms of code saved being very minor here but the win in terms of quality
    by default is a nice win。

    leave this information out and you have to guess what parameters we used to make
    them。

    any of this and this stuff is actually left in your class and when you're handwriting

    Total Ordering also implemented as a class decorator。 However it didn't have this
    by default this stronger check to make sure that the classes are the same to prevent
    accidental comparison。 Another interesting thing is when we made it frozen we
    wanted to be immutable so you can't write to it or delete an attribute。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    do so is by using a read-only property。 In this case though we extend set adder。

    don't call super。

    and day letter。 This is different from what most people would write by hand like
    what you see in the fractions module。 So these extended methods do call super
    so that we don't accidentally turn off an important behavior in the parent class。
    And the hatch method does write what you match what you would write by hand。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a quick comparison to name tuples all of these behaviors come for free because
    they're inherited for tuple。 And the ones in tuple are written in C so they're

    new list for us。 This is the default factory。 We don't want that to be part of
    the comparison or part of the repper。 That is pretty darn easy。 And to me， this
    is the most impressive example of what data classes can do。 How many of you like

- en: So I'll invite Eric to come on up and we'll give him a round of applause when
    he gets here。 So here are the challenges with using it。 One is it's currently
    tricky to add slots to a data class。 And slots is a pretty darn important optimization。
    It'll save you a lot of space and improve the speed of access of the fields。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So slots works just fine until you have default values。 And for deep reasons，
    they fight each other。 This is hard to fix but probably will be fixed。 If we fix
    it though。 almost certainly we're going to have to have the class decorator not
    modify the class in place but make a brand new class。 This will be irritating
    at so many levels。 The dunder init that's generated doesn't call super because
    most of the time that's not what we want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if you incur it from a class who's init does to be to call。 there's an interesting
    dunder method called post init that calls what you need。 There was some debate
    about whether to include a pre init。 but that probably won't happen unless somebody
    asks for it with a compelling idea。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's the compelling use case。 Also， data classes were designed to wrap
    around existing classes and it works really well with mutable classes。 But if
    the immutable， there's an immutable parent。 we don't have an easy way to override
    or extend the dunder new method。 It is really all about things that we're putting
    the data in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I tried to reinvent named tuple using data classes and it essentially did
    nothing for me other than create the wrapper and not in the way。 It's clean away
    as the named tuple did。 So there are some things that it's not good at。 Mostly
    it's good for a lot of things。 Future directions。 I expected over time people
    will request things that are in the adders package will come to be present in
    data classes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So at some point we'll probably have data valid or daters。 At some point we'll
    probably have better support for slots。 So I hope you enjoyed that tutorial and
    walk through。 I tried to give you simple cases。 slightly improved more common
    cases。 And then the corner case it said we took a challenging problem that had
    many specifications to it and boiled it down to something simple。

- en: Thanks for the talk。 There's one thing I can do if I hand write the Dunder in
    it。 I can make arguments keyword only by putting in an asterisk in the function
    signature。 Is there any support for that in declarative data class？ I'll say no。
    and then we'll get the right answer。 There's not。 Part of the reason is because
    it has to be arguments for Dunder in it or the order you do clear it on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It doesn't necessarily make sense that you somewhere in the list of fields you'd
    have to say， "Oh。 and everything after here is keyword only。" And it also doesn't
    work well with inheritance。 where if you inherit from something that had only
    keyword arguments。 then everything you had would suddenly have to become keyword
    argument only。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Because if you have a data class that inherits from another data class。 it adds
    the Dunder in it to the child class。 It just depends all of the fields together
    on the inherited classes。 Dunder in it。 So it has to everything in it because
    it doesn't call it the base and last。 Executive summary， it's harder than it looks。
    It is harder。
